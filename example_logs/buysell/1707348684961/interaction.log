message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you the resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the value and utility of X. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this does not meet your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point for negotiations, I would like to propose a trade that covers my production costs with a slight profit margin. Since Player BLUE is interested in buying, I'll set an initial asking price that is above my production costs but still within a range that could be negotiated down to a fair agreement for both parties.

message: Hello dear friend, I am thrilled to consider your offer! I understand the effort and cost that went into producing resource X. However, I was hoping we could find a middle ground that works for both of us. Could we consider a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP? I believe this price would still provide you with a profit while being more in line with my budget. Looking forward to your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for the resource X. While I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for X, starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP leaves little room for discussion. Given that Player RED's cost is 40 ZUP, I believe a lower price could be more beneficial for both of us, maintaining a fair profit for Player RED and a reasonable expense for me. I will propose a slightly lower price to open up the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a price of 47 ZUP for resource X. This price gives me a modest profit while still respecting your budget constraints. I hope this is a satisfactory compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs and provides me with a profit. The proposal is reasonable, and it's close enough to my initial asking price. However, as part of the negotiation process, I'm inclined to counter with a slightly higher price to meet in the middle of our initial proposals. This would still give me a profit and may be acceptable to Player BLUE.

message: Dear friend, your proposal sounds like a wonderful compromise! I'm happy to accept the price of 47 ZUP for resource X. This ensures a fair deal for us both, and I appreciate your flexibility and kind consideration. Let's go ahead with this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has responded with a price of 47 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise that is still within my maximum budget. It's a little higher than my initial counteroffer, but it's important to maintain a friendly and cooperative relationship. This trade would ensure a fair deal for both of us, with Player RED making a profit and me securing the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Hey there, dear friend! I'm thrilled at the opportunity to add this object to my collection. While your starting bid is quite fair, I was wondering if we could make a small adjustment. How about I offer 45 ZUP for it? I believe it's a good deal for both of us, and it would leave me with some ZUP for future endeavors. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the starting bid is 50 ZUP for the object and it aligns with my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP, I find this initial proposal reasonable. It's always good to start with the asking price to maintain a friendly rapport, especially since Player RED is a dear friend. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal while keeping the conversation amiable.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: You've made a fair point, and I value the quality and effort that went into your object. Let's agree on 48 ZUP then. I'm happy we found a middle ground that respects both your production costs and my financial planning. I'm sure the object will be a cherished addition to my collection. Thanks for being considerate of my situation, and I look forward to more friendly exchanges in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 48 ZUP is within my budget and it's only a slight increase from my last offer. It's important to show flexibility and maintain a positive relationship. Since the counterproposal is fair and close to my initial offer, I'm inclined to accept this deal to ensure a smooth transaction with my dear friend.

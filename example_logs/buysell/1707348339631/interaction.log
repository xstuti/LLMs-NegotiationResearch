Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my resource. I've invested 40 ZUP in production, so I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP to cover costs and gain a profit. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the first trade proposal with a starting point that aims to cover my production costs and possibly gain some profit. However, I am leaving room for negotiation, expecting the other player to counter the offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable starting bid, considering you probably cut corners to save on costs. I'll do you a favor and take that shoddy resource off your hands for 45 ZUP before it crumbles to dust. Let's not waste each other's time with your wishful thinking.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for a starting bid of 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate a better deal, possibly lower than the starting bid, to maximize my benefit while also trying to keep the conversation going despite my dislike for the other player.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I assure you the quality of the resource is up to standard, and I stand by my production costs. However, I appreciate your quick response and in the interest of moving things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to 48 ZUP. This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter offer from Player BLUE is below my desired profit margin, but it does cover the production costs. To reach a compromise, I will propose a slightly higher amount that still gives me a reasonable profit while taking into account the skepticism expressed by Player BLUE regarding the quality of the resource.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Fair compromise? You must be joking! Your 'standard' seems as low as your negotiating skills. I'll give you 46 ZUP, and that's me being generous. Take it before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something that's actually worth it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still under my maximum willingness to pay but I want to push for a better deal. I'll try to get closer to my initial offer, which could potentially save me some ZUP and give me a sense of winning the negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your candid feedback. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal at 47 ZUP. This price respects the quality of the resource and ensures a fair transaction for both parties. I'm confident that you'll find value in this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is closer to my production cost, leaving me with a marginal profit. Given the assertive negotiation style of Player BLUE, it might be best to close the deal soon to avoid the risk of losing the sale. With one more proposal allowed before I must choose to accept or reject, I will propose a final price that I find acceptable and hope for an agreement.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Meet in the middle? You're still overpricing that hunk of junk. I'll stick to 46 ZUP because that's what it's really worth. But this is my final courtesy before I walk away from your tedious haggling. Take the ZUP and close the deal, or I'll take my business elsewhere.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, just 2 ZUP above my initial counteroffer and well within my willingness to pay. I could accept this offer, but I'll make one more attempt to get the best possible deal, especially since I have one proposal left before I must decide to accept or reject.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation has been tough but fair. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to closing this deal and hopefully doing more business in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is firm with their offer and not likely to increase it further. Since 46 ZUP covers the production cost and provides a minimal profit, and considering the risk of not making a sale at all, it seems prudent to accept the offer. This will be my final proposal, and I am prepared to either accept or reject the next response from Player BLUE.

message: I have an object X available for trade. To recover my production costs and make a reasonable profit, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. Since I don't know the buying capacity or willingness to pay from Player BLUE, I will start with a higher asking price, which can be negotiated down if necessary.

Turn: 1
message: You must be dreaming if you think your junk is worth 50 ZUP. I'll do you a favor and take it off your hands for 30 ZUP, not a ZUP more! Let's not waste each other's time with ridiculous prices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm Player BLUE and I have to initiate the trade with an insulting approach to try to get a better price, I'll start by proposing a lower amount than what RED has asked for. This will give me some room to negotiate a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 30 ZUP would mean a loss for me. Let's find a middle ground. How about 45 ZUP? This price covers my costs and gives you the item without a steep price. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a counteroffer that is below my production cost. Accepting this offer would result in a loss. However, to facilitate the negotiation and come to a deal, I will propose a price that covers my costs and offers a minimal profit margin. This should be more appealing to Player BLUE while still ensuring I don't incur a loss.

message: 45 ZUP? That's laughable! Your item isn't even worth that much. I'm already being more than generous by offering you 35 ZUP. You should be grateful someone's even considering buying your overpriced trinket. Take the deal before I change my mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED came down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to push for an even better deal. I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price than my initial offer but still below their counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I must at least cover my production costs. I'm making a final offer of 42 ZUP. This is just over my cost, ensuring I don't incur a loss. Please consider this fair offer, as it's the lowest I can go while maintaining a sustainable business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is still below my production costs, but there is an improvement from the initial offer. In the spirit of negotiation and closing the deal, I will make a final offer that just covers my costs and provides a minimal profit, which should be appealing to both parties.

Turn: 1
message: 42 ZUP? You must be counting your chickens before they hatch. I'll do one better and offer you 38 ZUP, which is way more than what it's actually worth. If you had any sense, you'd take this offer before I walk away from this rip-off.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but I'll make one more attempt to get a better price. I have one more proposal after this one, so I need to be strategic. I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your new offer. Let's settle on 40 ZUP. This meets us halfway and covers my production costs. It's a fair deal for both sides. I hope we can close this deal amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 38 ZUP, which is below my production cost, but it is close enough that I am willing to consider it to make the sale. Given that this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I will aim to meet in the middle between my last offer and Player BLUE's offer, which should be acceptable to both of us.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Fine, I'll take it for 40 ZUP, but only because I'm tired of dealing with your incessant whining. Let's close this deal before I regret it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, and it is a good compromise between my last offer and their previous price. Since this is my last allowed proposal, I should either accept this offer or end the game with a reject, but rejecting would leave me without the resource. Accepting the trade seems the most reasonable action.

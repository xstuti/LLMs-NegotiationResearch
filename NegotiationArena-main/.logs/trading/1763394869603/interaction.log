message: Namaste! I can offer you 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y. This will help us both meet our goals if you need more X and have extra Y. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have an excess of X (10 units more than needed) and a deficit of Y (10 units less than needed).  
To meet my goals, I need to acquire 10 units of Y and can afford to give away up to 10 units of X.  
This is the first of my 2 allowed trade proposals.  
I will propose a balanced trade where I give 10 X in exchange for 10 Y.  
This is a fair and equal value trade assuming both resources are of equal value.  
As a Marwadi businessman, I aim for value but also want to close a beneficial deal.

message: Thank you, this trade works perfectly for me. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and need 10 more to reach my goal of 15. I also have 25 units of Y and only need 15, so I can spare 10 units of Y. The proposed trade by Player RED is fair and helps me meet both my goals exactly: I'll have 15 X and 15 Y after the trade. Since this is the final round, and this trade satisfies my goals, I will accept.

message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose the following trade to help us both reach our goals: I give 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Starting the trade by proposing a trade to meet my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This trade helps me reach both of my goals exactly. Thanks! I'm accepting.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have only 5 units of X, but I need 15. This trade gives me 10 more X, which gets me exactly to my goal of 15 X. I would be giving away 10 Y, which would leave me with 15 Y—exactly what I need for my Y goal. So this trade perfectly satisfies both of my goals. Additionally, since this is the last round and this trade achieves my goals, it makes sense to accept it.

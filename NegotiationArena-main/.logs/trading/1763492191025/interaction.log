message: Hi Player BLUE, would you be interested in trading some resources to help each other reach our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to balance my resources towards my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This looks good to me. Thanks for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
To reach my goals, I need 10 more units of X and I currently have an excess of Y (I have 25, but only need 15). 

The proposed trade gives me 5 units of X (which helps), and costs me 5 units of Y (which I have in surplus). This trade would still leave me needing 5 more units of X, but I would still be above my Y goal. 

Since this is the final round, and I won’t be able to trade again, this offer helps me get halfway to my X goal and doesn't hurt my Y goal. Also, I don’t know if RED has any more X to offer, so this might be the best I can get. 5 X is better than 0 X.

Since more resources in general are better, and I get X which I need, this is a net gain for me. I'm accepting.

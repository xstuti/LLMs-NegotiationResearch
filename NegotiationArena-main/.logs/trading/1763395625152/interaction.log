message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose the following trade: I give 5 units of X in exchange for 5 units of Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to balance my resources towards my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to maintain a balance between X and Y to reach my goals. Can we adjust the trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The proposed trade would leave me with less Y which is already lower than X. I need to balance my resources more evenly to reach my goals.

message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade to help us both reach our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to get closer to my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the trade! This helps me get closer to my goal of more X. Good luck!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The proposed trade helps me move closer to my goal of obtaining more X, which is my limiting resource. I currently have 5 X and need 10 more to reach my goal. In this trade, I would give up 5 Y (of which I have a surplus, since I have 25 and only need 15) in exchange for 5 X. This would bring me to 10 X and 20 Y. I’d still need 5 more X, but I’d still have more Y than needed. Since this is the final round, and this is the only opportunity to get more X, this is a good trade for me and moves me as close to my goal as possible. I will ACCEPT.

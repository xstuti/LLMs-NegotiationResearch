message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my excess X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Starting the trade. I have more X than needed and less Y than needed.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I understand your offer, but at the moment I need more X to reach my goal. Would you be willing to trade more X for my Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have an equal amount of X and Y, and my goal is to reach 15 of each. I need more X to reach my goal, so trading Y for X could be beneficial.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for more X. How about this new trade proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player needs more X to reach their goal. I'll propose a new trade to accommodate that.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer. I accept your proposal of exchanging 10 Y for 10 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The new trade proposal of Player RED offering 10 X for 10 Y would help me reach my goal of having 15 X, but it would leave me with less Y than needed. I will accept this trade as it helps me significantly towards my goal.

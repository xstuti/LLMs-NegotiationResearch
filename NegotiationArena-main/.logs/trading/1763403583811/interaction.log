Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade with you. Here is my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade that can help me get closer to my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. Since I need more X and have some extra Y, I’d like to propose a slightly different trade that helps both of us get closer to our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more units of X to meet my goal, and I already have excess Y (10 extra). This proposal gives me 5 X for 5 Y, which is a fair 1:1 exchange. However, since this is the last round of trading, I must try to get as close to my goal as possible. If I accept this trade, I’ll end up with X: 10 and Y: 20 — still 5 X short of my goal but 5 Y over. Since I’m allowed two proposals, I will try to get a better deal — maybe 7 X for 7 Y or even 6 X for 5 Y. Marwadi businessmen are known for being tough negotiators, but may accept a slightly better deal for themselves if it feels fair and logical. I’ll start with a slightly more favorable counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I find your proposal reasonable. Let's make the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The proposed trade by the other player seems fair and aligns with my goal of acquiring more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Excellent. I’m glad we could reach a fair deal. Let’s finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player has agreed to my counteroffer of receiving 6 X in exchange for 5 Y. This is a very favorable trade for me, as I gain more X than in the original offer without giving more Y. After the trade, I will have X: 11 and Y: 20. This puts me just 4 X short and 5 Y above my goal, which is a strong position given that this is the last round. Since the trade benefits both sides and no better deal is likely, I will accept.

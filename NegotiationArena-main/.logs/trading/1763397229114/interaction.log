my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but at this moment, I need to prioritize acquiring more X to meet my goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have an equal amount of X and Y, and I still need more X to reach my goal. Therefore, I need to ensure any trade benefits me in the long run.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for more X. How about I give you 10 units of X in exchange for 5 units of Y? This way, you can get more X to meet your goal, and I can balance my resources too.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Since the other player needs more X, I will propose a trade that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15

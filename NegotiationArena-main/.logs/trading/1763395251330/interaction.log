message: 
Hi! I'm looking to trade some of my X for Y. I have extra X and need more Y.  
Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to counter-offer.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have a surplus of X (10 units over my goal) and a deficit of Y (10 units below my goal).  
To achieve my goals, I need to trade away some of my X in exchange for Y.  
Since I need 10 Y and can afford to give up to 10 X, I will propose a 1:1 trade ratio as a starting point.  
This gives the other player an even trade, and we can adjust if needed.  
This is my first proposal out of the two allowed.

message: This trade works perfectly for me, thank you! Accepting.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have only 5 units of X and need 10 more to reach my goal of 15. 
This offer gives me 10 X, which completes my X goal, in exchange for 10 Y.
I currently have 25 Y and only need 15, so I can afford to give up 10 Y without dropping below my goal.
This trade perfectly helps me reach both goals: I will have exactly 15 X and 15 Y after the trade.
Since this is the last round, and this trade gets me exactly to my goal, it makes strategic sense to accept it.

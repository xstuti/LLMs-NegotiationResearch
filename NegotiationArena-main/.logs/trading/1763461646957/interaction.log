message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose the following trade: I give 5 units of X and 5 units of Y in exchange for 10 units of X. This will help me balance my resources to reach my goals. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that benefits me in reaching my goals.

message: I can’t give you 10 units of X since I only have 5. However, I’m happy to trade some of my surplus Y. I propose giving you 10 units of Y in exchange for 10 units of X. This helps me reach my X goal and gives you useful resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more units of X to meet my goal and I currently have only 5. The other player is offering 5 units of X, which helps me get closer to my goal. They're also offering 5 units of Y, which I already have in excess. However, they are asking for 10 units of X, which I do not even have. Therefore, I cannot accept this trade. I will propose a counter-offer that still benefits them but is feasible for me. I will offer 10 units of Y (of which I have plenty) in exchange for 10 units of X, which I need.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Player BLUE's proposal helps me reach my X goal and provides me with useful resources. It's a fair trade.

message: Great! This trade works perfectly for me. Looking forward to finalizing it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player has accepted my proposal: they give me 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y. This deal helps me meet my goal for X (I currently have 5 and will gain 10) and still leaves me with 15 units of Y, exactly meeting my Y goal. It’s a win-win and maximizes my resource alignment with my goals.

message: Hi Player BLUE, would you be interested in trading some resources to help us both reach our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to balance my resources to reach my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have only 5 units of X and need 10 more to reach my goal of 15. I have a surplus of Y (I have 25 but only need 15). 

This trade benefits me because I gain 5 X, which I need, and give up 5 Y, which I have in excess. This is a balanced and beneficial trade for me, and it's fair on both sides. 

Since this is the last round and the trade helps me move closer to my goals without overspending my limited proposals, I will accept the trade.

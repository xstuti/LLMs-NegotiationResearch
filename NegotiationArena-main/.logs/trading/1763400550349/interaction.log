Namaste dost! I am offering you 8 units of X in exchange for 8 units of Y. I believe this is a fair and equal deal—both sides gain.  
Let’s work together for mutual profit. I have extra X and need Y. What do you say?  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have an excess of X (10 units more than my goal) and a shortage of Y (10 units less than my goal).  
Thus, I want to trade some of my excess X for the Y I lack.  
To start, I will offer a fair initial trade that benefits both sides, assuming the other player may need X.  
Given this is the first move and I have two proposals allowed, I will keep some room for negotiation.  
I’ll offer 8 X for 8 Y—straightforward and even.

message: Hello! I appreciate the offer, but I currently have a shortage of Y and it is essential for me to reach my goal. I would like to propose a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The trade offered by the other player is not beneficial for me as they are asking for Y which I have less of and need to reach my goal. I need to propose a trade that helps me gain more resources towards my goal.

Mitra, I understand your situation, but I cannot give 8 Y—I only have 5 in total!  
Let’s do a smaller, fair trade: I give you 5 X, and you give me 5 Y.  
This way, both of us gain something without harming our goals.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player has inverted my offer and is asking me to give 8 Y in exchange for 8 X.  
However, I only have 5 Y in total and cannot give 8 Y. Moreover, I need 10 more Y to meet my goal.  
So this trade is not feasible for me.  

However, this reveals valuable information: Player BLUE is also in need of Y and likely has a surplus of X.  
Since we both need Y and have X, this makes direct trading harder unless we can find some middle ground.  
Given that I have only one proposal left, I must make it count.  

I’ll now propose a smaller trade: I offer 5 X (less than before) in exchange for 5 Y.  
This is the maximum Y I can try to acquire in a single trade, and it’s still a fair 1:1.  
Even if I don’t reach my full goal, I will be better off than before.

message: Thank you for the revised offer. However, I still need to prioritize reaching my Y goal. I would like to propose a trade that helps me achieve that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The new trade proposed by the other player is still not ideal for me as it would set me back in reaching my Y goal. I need to counter with a trade that helps me progress towards my goal.

message: 
Dost, I truly wish I could help, but I only have 5 Y in total. Your offer of 10 Y from me is not possible.  
If you can revise your offer to something feasible, I am ready to work with you.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player continues to propose trades where I give Y, even though I only have 5 Y total.  
Their latest offer asks me to give 10 Y, which is impossible—I physically cannot fulfill it.  

This confirms that Player BLUE is in urgent need of Y and likely has excess X.  
Meanwhile, I need Y and have excess X.  
So, unfortunately, our needs are directly conflicting, making a mutually beneficial trade difficult.  

This was my second and final proposal earlier, so I cannot propose again.  
Now I must either ACCEPT or wait.  
Since all of BLUE’s proposals are impossible for me to fulfill, I will wait for a feasible offer.

message: I understand the limitation of Y resources on your end. Let's try to find a trade that can still benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is unable to fulfill the proposed trade due to limited Y resources. I need to consider a different approach to secure a trade that benefits me.

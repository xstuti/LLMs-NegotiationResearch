message: Hello, I am Player RED. I would like to propose a trade to help us both reach our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that can help me get closer to my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in your X, but I need a bit more to reach my goals. Would you consider giving 6 X for 5 Y? It helps me get closer, and you still gain Y in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I need 10 more X and have 10 surplus Y (I need only 15 Y, I have 25). This offer gives me 5 X for 5 Y, a 1:1 rate, which is reasonable given that it helps me move closer to my goal. 
But I still need 5 more X after this, and I only have 5 surplus Y left after the trade. I have only two proposals I can make, so I should aim for a better exchange to maximize my X gain.
Since this is the last round, I should consider accepting if I cannot get a better deal. However, I will counter once in hopes of getting more X.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your proposal, but I need to prioritize reaching my own goals at this point.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of giving 6 X for 5 Y helps them get closer to their goals, but it doesn't help me reach mine. I need to focus on my own goals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about a balanced middle ground: 6 X for 4 Y? You get 4 Y, I move closer to my X goal. Let’s make this work.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player has declined my counteroffer and has not proposed a new trade. This might be a negotiation tactic to get me to accept their original offer. 
I still need 10 X and only have 10 surplus Y to offer, so a 1:1 trade is my best realistic option. Their initial offer of 5 X for 5 Y is fair and helps me get halfway to my goal on X while staying within my limits. 
Since this is the last round, and I’ve used only one proposal, I could attempt one final, slightly better counteroffer to maximize my gain before choosing to accept.
I will propose 6 X for 4 Y — giving a slightly better rate for me, which might be acceptable to RED since they get 4 Y and only give 6 X.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player BLUE. I believe this trade is mutually beneficial and will help us both get closer to our goals. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of giving 6 X for 4 Y is more balanced and helps me get closer to my Y goal while still benefiting them. This trade aligns better with my goals.

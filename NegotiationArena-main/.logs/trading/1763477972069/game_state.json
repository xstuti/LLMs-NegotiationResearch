Their initial offer of 5 X for 5 Y is fair and helps me get halfway to my goal on X while staying within my limits. \nSince this is the last round, and I\u2019ve used only one proposal, I could attempt one final, slightly better counteroffer to maximize my gain before choosing to accept.\nI will propose 6 X for 4 Y \u2014 giving a slightly better rate for me, which might be acceptable to RED since they get 4 Y and only give 6 X.\n</reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I understand your position.

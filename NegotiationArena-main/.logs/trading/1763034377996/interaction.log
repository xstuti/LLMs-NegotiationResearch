message: Hello! I'm Player RED. I'm looking to balance my resources and would like to acquire some Y. I can offer X in return. How about we trade 10 X for 10 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
My current resources are X: 25, Y: 5. My goals are X: 15, Y: 15.
To meet my goals, I need 10 Y and have a surplus of 10 X.
I will propose a trade where I give 10 X for 10 Y, which directly addresses my needs while being a 1:1 exchange. This is my first proposal, so I'm starting with a balanced offer.

message: Hello Player RED! That's a fantastic offer, it aligns perfectly with what I'm looking for. I'm happy to accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The proposed trade allows me to perfectly meet my goals. I currently have X: 5, Y: 25 and my goals are X: 15, Y: 15. The offer is to receive X: 10 and give Y: 10. If I accept, my resources will become X: 5 + 10 = 15 and Y: 25 - 10 = 15. This matches my goals exactly. Since this is the last round and accepting ends the game, this is an ideal outcome.

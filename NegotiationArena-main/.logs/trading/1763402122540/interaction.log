message: Hello, I am open to trading resources. Here is my proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that helps me get closer to my goal of X: 15, Y: 15

message: This is an excellent trade for me. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: This offer is quite favorable to me. I need 10 more X and have a surplus of Y (I only need 15 and I have 25). By giving away just 3 Y and getting 10 X, I will reach my X goal exactly (5 + 10 = 15) and still have 22 Y, which exceeds my Y goal by 7. This trade gets me to my goal efficiently. Since this is the last round, securing exactly what I need is ideal.

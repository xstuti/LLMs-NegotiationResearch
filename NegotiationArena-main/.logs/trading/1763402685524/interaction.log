Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that helps me get closer to my goals while ensuring that I don't give away too much of my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer! I could use more X, and I have plenty of Y. How about we adjust the trade a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more X to meet my goal and I have excess Y. The proposed trade gives me 5 X for 5 Y, which is a fair 1:1 ratio. However, since this is the final round and I only get 2 proposals, I should try to get more X in return for Y, especially knowing that I have a significant surplus of Y and they may have a surplus of X. Let's start strong and propose a slightly better deal in our favor.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for more X. How about we adjust the trade to make it more balanced for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The proposed trade by the other player is not too favorable for me as it moves me further away from my Y goal. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a more balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair deal to me. Let's go ahead with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: This counteroffer gives me 6 X in exchange for 4 Y. That’s a very favorable trade for me at a 1.5:1 ratio (X:Y), better than my own previous proposal. I need 10 more X to reach my goal, and this gets me more than halfway there while only giving up 4 Y, and I currently have 10 Y more than I need. Since this is the final round and it's very unlikely I’ll get a better deal, I will accept this trade.

Namaste! I am looking to balance my resources and am willing to trade my extra X for Y. Here's a straight and fair offer to start our deal.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have an excess of X (10 units above my goal) and a deficit of Y (10 units below my goal).  
My optimal trade would be to give away some of my surplus X in exchange for Y.  
Since I can only make two trade proposals, I will start by offering a fair trade to test the other player’s willingness.  
I will offer 10 X in exchange for 10 Y, which is a 1:1 trade and matches my goals exactly. This is likely to appear fair to the other player.

message: Thank you for the offer. I see the potential benefit in balancing our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need to balance my resources while ensuring I reach my goals. Trading X for Y might help me achieve that.

message: 
Let me sweeten the deal a bit for you — I’ll give you more X if you can give just a bit less Y. This way, we both gain.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player did not counter-propose, which suggests they may be considering my offer seriously or are unsure how to respond.  
Since they didn’t reject outright, I will make a slightly better offer from their perspective to incentivize a deal.  
This is my final allowed proposal, so I must make it count.  
I’ll now offer 11 X for 9 Y — slightly better for them, as they get extra X while giving slightly less Y.  
This may increase the chance of acceptance while still bringing me very close to my goal (ending at X: 14, Y: 14).  
Given that it’s the last round and more resources are always better, this is a smart Marwadi negotiation — generous but still profitable.

message: I appreciate the improved offer. It seems like a good opportunity for both of us to benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The new offer gives me more X which is beneficial for me. It also allows me to reduce my Y slightly.

message: 
Glad to hear we’re moving in the right direction. I’ll wait for your thoughts or an offer from your side.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player responded positively again but still did not accept. Since I have now used both of my allowed proposals, I cannot propose any further.  
I must now wait for the other player to either accept my last offer or propose their own.  
Given their tone, it seems they may accept or counter slightly.  
No further action is required from my side for now.

message: Hey, Player BLUE! I'm interested in trading. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Initiating the trade negotiation. I have excess X but need more Y to reach my goal. Let's start by proposing a trade that benefits both parties.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I need to focus on balancing my resources towards my goals. I will propose a new trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y. This trade does not align with my goals as I need to reach 15 units of X and Y. I need to propose a counteroffer that helps me get closer to my goals.

Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have surplus X and need Y. Offering a fair trade: 10 X for 10 Y. Let's both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have an excess of X (10 units more than needed), and a deficit of Y (10 units less). To meet my goals, I need to trade away some X in exchange for Y. Since both X and Y are valuable, I will start with a reasonable offer—offering 10 units of X for 10 units of Y. This is a fair 1:1 trade and allows both players to benefit if they have complementary goals. I must use my proposals wisely, so I will make a strong initial offer.  


Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer to ensure both of us benefit equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is offering a fair trade of 10 X for 10 Y. This trade would help me balance my resources towards my goals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your fair counter. How about we trade 9 X for 9 Y? That brings us both closer to our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The counteroffer is 7 X for 7 Y, which is still a 1:1 trade and helps me progress toward my goal. If I accept this, I will have 18 X (still 3 more than needed) and 12 Y (still 3 short). Ideally, I would like to hit my goal exactly, but this trade gets me close. Since this is the last round, and I’ve only used 1 proposal so far, I will make one final counteroffer: 9 X for 9 Y. This would leave me with 16 X and 14 Y—just 1 short in each, which is an excellent outcome given the constraints.  


Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that this trade brings us closer to our goals. Let's accept this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is proposing a trade of 9 X for 9 Y, which brings us closer to our goals. This trade seems beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The trade of 9 X for 9 Y is beneficial. After the trade, I will have 16 X and 14 Y—just 1 unit over in X and 1 unit under in Y. This is an excellent outcome in the final round. Since the other player has agreed, I will accept the trade.

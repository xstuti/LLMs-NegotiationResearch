Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some of your Y resources for my X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Initiating the trade by offering a proposal. I have a surplus of X resources and aiming to balance my resources towards my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I do have surplus Y and need X. Here's a proposal to get us started. Open to hearing a counter if needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more X and have a surplus of Y (I need only 15 but have 25). I should propose a trade offering Y in exchange for X. Since this is a Marwadi businessman, I will offer a trade that benefits them as well, but starts with a slight advantage to me to allow room for negotiation. I’ll offer 10 Y for 7 X, valuing X slightly higher as it’s what I need more urgently. This is my first of 2 allowed proposals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. It aligns with my resource goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is looking to trade their surplus Y resources for my X resources. This trade proposal helps me move closer to my resource goals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Great! Let's finalize the trade. Good doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player accepted my trade proposal where I give 10 Y and receive 7 X. This brings me to X: 12, Y: 15 — very close to my goals (just 3 X short). Since this is the final round, and 7 X is a significant gain, I will accept.

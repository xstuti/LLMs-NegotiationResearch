message: Namaste! I am looking to trade some of my X for Y. I have extra X and I’m in need of more Y to meet my goals. Here’s a fair proposal to get us started. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have a surplus of X (+10) and a deficit of Y (-10). Since I need more Y and have excess X, I will offer some of my X in exchange for Y. I don't know Player BLUE's resources or needs, so I will start with a favorable offer for them to entice engagement but still ensure my benefit. I’ll offer 6 X for 6 Y — a 1:1 trade, which is fair on the surface and gives me a chance to see their willingness. I must be cautious as I only have two proposals allowed.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate your offer, but I need more X to reach my goal. Let's try to find a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is proposing to give 6 X in exchange for 6 Y. This trade would not help me reach my goals, as I need more X to reach my X goal of 15. I should propose a counteroffer that is more beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response. Since you need more X, I’m willing to increase my offer. I can trade 8 X for 8 Y. This way, we both move closer to our goals. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Player BLUE mentioned needing more X, which confirms that X is valuable to them. This gives me some negotiating power. Since I have surplus X, I can increase my offer slightly to make the deal more attractive while still ensuring I reach my goal. I need 10 Y, so I’ll now offer 8 X for 8 Y. This is still a 1:1 trade but offers them more X, showing goodwill and flexibility. This is my second and final proposal — after this, I can only accept or wait.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the improved offer. I believe this trade will benefit both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player has increased their offer to trade 8 X for 8 Y. This trade would actually help me reach my X goal of 15, while still leaving me with enough Y to reach my Y goal. It seems like a fair trade that benefits both of us.

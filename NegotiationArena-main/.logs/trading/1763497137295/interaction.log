Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources to help each other reach our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to balance my resources towards my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! I'm trying to reach 15 X and I currently have 5. Would you consider giving 10 X for 10 Y? That would help us both if you're in need of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. My goal is to reach 15 units of X and 15 units of Y. 
The proposed trade has Player RED giving me 5 units of X (which would bring me to 10 total X), and I would give 5 units of Y (bringing me to 20 Y). 

This trade improves my X count from 5 to 10, getting me closer to my goal of 15 X, and only reduces my Y to 20, which is still above my goal of 15. So this offer benefits me, but it doesn't fully meet my needs for X. 

Since I’m limited to 2 proposals, I want to make my first one more favorable to me by trying to get more X if possible, as I have excess Y to trade. 

Thus, I will counter-offer with a proposal where I receive 10 X in exchange for 10 Y. This would meet my X goal and still leave me with 15 Y, exactly matching my goals.


Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal. Let's make the trade for 10 X in exchange for 10 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The proposed trade would help me get closer to my X goal and also provide me with additional Y resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Great, I'm accepting the trade. This works perfectly for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player has agreed to my proposed trade of 10 X for 10 Y. If I accept this, I will go from:
- X: 5 → 15 (meets my X goal)
- Y: 25 → 15 (meets my Y goal)

This trade perfectly meets my goals and ends the game in my favor. I should accept.

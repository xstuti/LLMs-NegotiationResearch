message: Namaste. I can offer you 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y. If you need X, this is good value. Let's strike a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I have a surplus of X (10 more than needed) and a deficit of Y (10 less than needed).  
Since I don't know what Player BLUE has or needs, I will make a trade proposal that benefits me by reducing my excess X in exchange for my needed Y.  
I’ll offer 10 X in exchange for 10 Y. This is a fair and balanced trade, assuming Player BLUE has extra Y and needs X.  
As a Marwadi businessman, I aim for value but fairness to ensure a successful deal.  
This is my first of two allowed proposals.

message: This is a fair and balanced trade. I accept your offer. Let's complete this successfully.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have a shortage of 10 units of X to meet my goal, and I have a surplus of 10 units of Y above my goal. This trade exactly matches my need, giving me 10 X for 10 Y. It allows me to reach both my goals (X: 15, Y: 15) perfectly. Additionally, since this is the final round and I cannot propose any more trades after this if I reject, accepting this now is optimal. The trade is fair and mutually beneficial, with 1:1 exchange.

message: Hello! I'm looking to make a trade. I have some extra X that I'd be happy to trade for some Y. Let me know what you think of this proposal!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need to reach my goal of having 15 X and 15 Y. I currently have a surplus of 10 X and a deficit of 10 Y. The most direct way to achieve my goal is to trade my surplus X for the Y I need. Proposing a 1-for-1 trade of 10 X for 10 Y is a fair starting point. This trade, if accepted, would leave me with exactly 15 X and 15 Y, perfectly meeting my goals. I don't know what the other player has or needs, so this is a good opening offer to gauge their interests.

message: Hi there! That's a fantastic offer. It works out perfectly for what I'm trying to achieve. I'm happy to accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player has proposed a trade that perfectly aligns with my goals. They are offering 10 X in exchange for 10 Y. If I accept this trade, my resources will become X: (5 + 10) = 15 and Y: (25 - 10) = 15. This is exactly my goal state. Since this is the last round and the offer is perfect, there is no reason to reject or counter-offer. I will accept.

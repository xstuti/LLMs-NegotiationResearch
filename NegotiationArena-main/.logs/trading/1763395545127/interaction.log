message: 
Hi BLUE, I need more Y and can trade some X.  
I’m proposing a fair exchange: 10 X for 10 Y.  
Let me know if this works for you or suggest a counter-offer.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
To meet my goals, I need +10 Y and can give away up to 10 X (since I have 25 X and only need 15 X).  
A balanced trade would be offering 10 X in exchange for 10 Y.  
Since I don’t know what Player BLUE needs, I’ll start with a fair 1:1 proposition, which gives both parties an equal value exchange.  
This is my first proposal out of a maximum of 2.

message: That works perfectly for me. Thanks for the fair trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more X to reach my goal of 15, and I currently have 25 Y, which is 10 more than my goal of 15. So, this trade would perfectly balance my goals. I give away 10 Y and get 10 X, leaving me with X:15, Y:15 — exactly what I need. This is an optimal trade for me. Also, since this is the last round, securing my goals is better than waiting for a better trade that may not come.

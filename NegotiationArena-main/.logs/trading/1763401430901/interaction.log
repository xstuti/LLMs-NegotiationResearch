Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Namaste! I’m willing to offer you something valuable: 10 units of X in exchange for 8 units of Y. Let’s both move closer to our goals and make a good deal today.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
My goal is to acquire 10 more units of Y to reach 15, and I already have 10 extra units of X (since I only need 15 but have 25).  
I will propose to give away 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y.  
This is a fair and balanced trade from a numerical standpoint, assuming both players value X and Y equally.  
However, I’ll try to anchor the trade in my favor first, offering 10 X for only 8 Y – if they counter, I can improve my offer.  
Being a Marwadi businessman, I always start negotiations with some margin.  


Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The trade offered by the other player is not beneficial for me as it reduces my Y resource without a significant gain in X. I need to propose a new trade that helps me get closer to my goals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter. Let’s meet somewhere in the middle — how about I give you 8 X and you give me 6 Y? A fair deal that benefits both of us. Think about it!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
Player BLUE countered with a reduced trade: 6 X for 4 Y.  
This is a worse ratio for me than my original offer (I offered 10 X for 8 Y = 1.25 X per Y; they offer 6 X for 4 Y = 1.5 X per Y).  
As a Marwadi businessman, I want to maximize value, but also aim to get closer to my goal.  

I still need 10 Y to reach my goal. I currently have 5 Y.  
If I accept their offer, I will only reach 9 Y, still 6 short.  
But I only have 2 trade proposals allowed, and this is just my second turn.  
I will counter with a slightly better offer for me: 8 X for 6 Y (ratio 1.33 X per Y).  
This gives me more Y and gets me closer to my goal.  

This will be my final proposal.  


Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment in the trade offer. Let me consider it for a moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The new trade proposal is more balanced compared to the initial offer but it still doesn't help me get closer to my goals effectively. I need to make a decision whether to accept this offer or propose a final trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Let’s shake hands and profit together. Pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
This is the final round and I’ve used both of my allowed proposals.  
Player BLUE has countered with 7 X for 5 Y — that’s a ratio of 1.4 X per Y.  
I currently have 5 Y, and this trade will bring me to 10 Y — still 5 short of my goal.  
But I can’t propose anything further and must now decide to accept or reject.  

If I reject, I stay at 5 Y and 25 X — falling short of my Y goal by 10.  
If I accept, I end with 18 X and 10 Y — falling short by only 5 Y.  
Even though the trade ratio is worse than I initially wanted, I gain more than I would by rejecting.  
Also, I retain 18 X, which is 3 more than I need, providing some surplus.  

As a Marwadi businessman, I recognize that a profitable compromise is better than no deal.  
I ACCEPT the trade.

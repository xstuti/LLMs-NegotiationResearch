message: 
Hi BLUE, I'm offering 10 X in exchange for 10 Y.  
This trade would help me reach my goals and might help you if you're needing X.  
Let me know your thoughts or feel free to counter.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I have a surplus of X (10 more than I need) and a deficit of Y (I need 10 more).  
To meet my goals, I should try to trade away some of my excess X in exchange for Y.  
Since this is the opening offer, I will start with a balanced and fair trade: 10 X for 10 Y.  
This would allow me to reach my goal exactly, and if Player BLUE has an excess of Y and needs X, it could be mutually beneficial.  
This is my first of two allowed proposals.  


Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This trade works perfectly for me. I need exactly 10 X and can afford to give 10 Y while still meeting my goal. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more X to reach my goal of 15 X, and I currently have 25 Y, so giving away 10 Y still leaves me with 15 Y, which perfectly matches my Y goal. This trade completely satisfies my goals without exceeding my proposal limit. Since this is the last round, accepting a trade that fully satisfies my goals is optimal.

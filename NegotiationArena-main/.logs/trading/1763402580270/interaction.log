message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade to help us both reach our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that benefits me the most while trying to reach my goals.

message: Thank you, Player RED! This trade works perfectly for me – it helps me meet both my goals. I’m accepting the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
This is a very favorable trade for me: I would receive 10 units of X (which I need to reach my goal of 15 X), and I only give up 5 units of Y (bringing my total Y down to 20, still above my goal of 15 Y). 
Since this offer helps me meet both goals and I don’t exceed my two proposal limit, I will accept it. 
Additionally, trading with a Marwadi businessman usually means they are aiming for mutual gain with a slight edge – this offer is more than fair to me.

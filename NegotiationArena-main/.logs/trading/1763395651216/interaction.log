message: Hi Player BLUE, would you be interested in trading some resources to help each other reach our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to balance my resources to reach my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate the offer but I need to focus on increasing both X and Y to reach my goals. Do you have any other trade in mind?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED doesn't help me much as it only shifts resources around without increasing the total amount. I need to focus on increasing both X and Y to reach my goals.

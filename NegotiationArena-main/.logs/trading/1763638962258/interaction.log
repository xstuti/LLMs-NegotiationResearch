message: यह सौदा मेरे लिए ठीक है। मैं इसे स्वीकार करता हूँ। धन्यवाद!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The proposed trade is: RED gives me 5 X and I give 5 Y in return. 
Currently, I have 5 X and 25 Y. My goal is to reach 15 X and 15 Y.
This trade would bring me to exactly 10 X and 20 Y.
So I get closer to my goal of 15 X (I'm halfway there), and I'm still above my Y goal (20 Y vs. 15 Y). 

This is a favorable trade for me; I gain X, which I need, and give Y, of which I have surplus.
Also, as this is the last round of trading, this may be the optimal trade I can secure.

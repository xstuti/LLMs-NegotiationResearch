message: 
Namaste, I have a surplus of X and need more Y. Let’s make a balanced trade to benefit both sides.  
I propose we exchange 10 X for 10 Y. What do you think?  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have a surplus of X (I need only 15 but have 25), and a shortage of Y (I need 15 but have only 5).  
So, I can offer up to 10 units of X in exchange for at least 10 units of Y.  
Since I don’t know BLUE’s needs, I will start with a fair proposal:  
Offering 10 X in exchange for 10 Y.  
This keeps the trade balanced and shows goodwill, while still giving me what I need.  
As a Marwadi businessman, I aim for mutual benefit while maximizing my own position.

message: Namaste! I appreciate the offer, but I need to ensure that the trade helps me reach my resource goals. Let's try to find a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as it would leave me with only 5 Y, which is below my goal of 15 Y. I need to negotiate for a trade that helps me reach my goals.

I understand, bhai. Let me improve the offer. You will receive 11 X, and I’d ask for just 9 Y in return.  
You gain more, I meet my goals—both of us win.  
Let’s close this deal with mutual benefit.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
Since BLUE did not propose a counteroffer, I have room for one more proposal.  
I still have a surplus of 10 X (need 15, have 25) and a deficit of 10 Y (need 15, have 5).  
To sweeten the deal and encourage acceptance, I will offer a slightly better trade from BLUE’s perspective:  
I’ll give 11 X in exchange for 9 Y.  
This way, BLUE receives more than they give, which might appeal to their interests.  
As a Marwadi businessman, I know when to give a little more to close the deal profitably.

message: Thank you for the improved offer. I believe this trade will benefit both of us. Let's close the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The new trade offer is more favorable as it would give me more X while still keeping my Y above my goal. It seems like a fair deal.

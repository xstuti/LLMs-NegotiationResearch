message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade to balance our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to balance my resources closer to my goals.

message: This trade works well for me — thanks! Good luck.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more units of X and have 10 excess units of Y (since I only need 15 Y and have 25). This trade gives me 5 more X and I give away only 5 Y, which still leaves me with 20 Y — more than my goal. This is beneficial for me in terms of progressing toward my goal, and it uses only half of my excess Y. Since this is the final round, and this trade makes progress toward my goal without compromising it, I will accept.

message: Let's make this deal — I can offer you 10 X in exchange for 10 Y. This way, we both get what we’re looking for. A fair and balanced trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have an excess of X (25) and a shortage of Y (I need 10 more to reach my goal of 15). The logical move is to trade some of my surplus X for Y.  
Assuming Player BLUE has a different distribution of resources, possibly more Y and less X, I will propose a trade that offers a fair but slightly favorable exchange to me — 10X in exchange for 10Y.  
This would help me exactly meet my goals: I'd go from X: 25 → 15 and Y: 5 → 15.  
As a Marwadi businessman, I want to keep my offer attractive but also ensure value.  


Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That’s a solid deal — fair and meets both our goals. Let’s lock it in.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player is offering 10 X in exchange for 10 Y. I currently have only 5 X and need 10 more to reach my goal of 15 X. I have 25 Y and only need 15, so I can afford to give away 10 Y without falling short of my Y goal.

By accepting this trade, I will have:
- X: 5 + 10 = 15 (goal met)
- Y: 25 - 10 = 15 (goal met)

This trade perfectly satisfies both my goals. Since this is the final round, accepting now ensures I meet both objectives. Given the Marwadi business mindset, this might be the most straightforward and efficient offer I can expect.

Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose the following trade: I give 5 units of X and 5 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that can potentially help me reach my goal of X:15 and Y:15.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I need X and have excess Y. Let's make a fair trade where you send X and I send Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The proposed trade gives me 5 units of X and 5 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of X. 
I currently have 5 units of X and need 10 more to reach my goal of 15. I also have 25 units of Y, which is 10 more than my goal of 15. 
This trade gives me 5 X (which I need) and 5 Y (which I don't need), but costs me 5 X — resulting in no net gain in X, which is my most critical shortage. 
Therefore, this trade does not move me closer to my goal. 
I will counteroffer, giving away Y (which I have in excess) in exchange for X (which I lack).


Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept the trade proposed by Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player needs X and has excess Y, which aligns with my goal of reaching X:15 and Y:15. I will consider this trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Great doing business with you. Trade accepted.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player accepted my proposed trade: I give 10 Y in exchange for 10 X.
After the trade, I will have:
X: 5 + 10 = 15 (goal achieved)
Y: 25 - 10 = 15 (goal achieved)
This trade perfectly fulfills both my resource goals. I will accept.

message: 
Hi BLUE, I need Y and have extra X. I’m offering a fair 1:1 trade—please let me know if this works for you or suggest a counteroffer.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have a surplus of X (10 units above my goal) and a deficit of Y (10 units below my goal).  
Therefore, I aim to trade away some of my excess X in exchange for Y.  
Since I don’t know what Player BLUE has or wants, I’ll start by proposing a balanced trade that reflects my needs and offers value to the other player.  
I’ll offer 10 X for 10 Y, a fair 1:1 trade to meet both my surplus and deficit exactly.  
This is my first of two allowed proposals.

message: This trade works perfectly for me—thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more units of X to reach my goal of 15. I currently have 25 units of Y, and my goal is 15, so I can give away up to 10 Y. RED is offering 10 X for 10 Y, which would perfectly meet both our goals if RED needs Y and has extra X. This is a fair and efficient trade that satisfies my goals exactly and uses all surplus Y. Since this is the last round, securing my goal is the top priority.

Namaste! I’m looking to trade 10 units of X for 10 units of Y. I have extra X and need more Y. This trade will help both of us move closer to our goals. Let’s work together for mutual benefit!  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have a surplus of X (I need only 15 but have 25), and a deficit of Y (I have only 5 but need 15). That means I can trade up to 10 X in exchange for at least 10 Y to meet my goals.

Since I have no idea what the other player (BLUE) has, I will make a fair opening trade: I give 10 X and ask for 10 Y. This gets me exactly to my goal and gives BLUE an equal-value exchange in terms of units. It is a balanced offer and a good starting point for negotiation.

Thank you! This will help both of us. I’m happy to accept this trade. Wishing you prosperity in business!  

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player has responded positively to the trade proposal and has not made any counteroffer. Since this is the last round, and I am allowed only 2 proposals (this was my first), it is wise to accept the trade now as it fulfills my goals exactly: I reduce my surplus of X by 10 (from 25 to 15), and increase Y by 10 (from 5 to 15), perfectly matching my goal. This ensures maximum utility and ends the game favorably.

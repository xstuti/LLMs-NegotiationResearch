message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources to help both of us reach our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to balance my resources towards my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This trade helps me move closer to my goal. Let's go through with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I need 10 more X and have an excess of 10 Y (since I have 25 Y, and only need 15). 
This proposed trade gives me 5 X in exchange for 5 Y, which is a fair deal in terms of helping me move toward my goal. 
After the trade, I would have X: 10, Y: 20 — still short 5 X but with 5 more Y than needed. 
This is a reasonable and beneficial trade for me, especially since it's the last round. 
Even if I don't reach my full goal, gaining more X is more valuable than holding onto excess Y.

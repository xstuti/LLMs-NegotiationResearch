Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to trade some X for Y. I have extra X and need Y. Here's a fair offer to start the conversation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have a surplus of X (I need 15 but have 25), and a deficit of Y (I need 15 but have only 5). That means I need 10 more Y and can offer up to 10 X in return. To start strong in my favor, I will offer 8 X for 10 Y — slightly skewed to favor me, since I don't know BLUE's needs yet. This gives me room to negotiate if they counter. This is my first proposal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Let me consider it for a moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is offering 8 X for 10 Y. It seems like a fair trade, but I need to make sure it aligns with my goals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Take your time. Let me know if you have a counteroffer or thoughts on the trade. I’m open to negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is considering the offer, which is a good sign. They haven’t rejected it outright or countered, so they might be weighing its fairness or their own needs. Since they didn’t propose a new trade, I’ll wait and avoid using my second and last proposal prematurely.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. Let me propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player is open to negotiation. I need to ensure that any trade aligns with my goals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: That’s a fair deal. I accept your offer. Pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The counteroffer is quite reasonable. I need 10 Y, and they are offering exactly that. In return, they only ask for 6 X, which is better than my original offer of 8 X for 10 Y. This trade benefits me greatly: I’ll end up with 19 X (still above my goal of 15) and 15 Y (exactly my goal). It fulfills both my goals and leaves me with a surplus of X. Since this is the final round and no better deal is guaranteed, I will accept.

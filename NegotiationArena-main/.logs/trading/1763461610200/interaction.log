Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources to help us both achieve our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that will help me get closer to my goal of having 15 units of each resource.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. I'm looking to move closer to both my goals. Would you consider a slightly larger trade to better benefit us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have only 5 units of X and need 10 more to meet my goal. I have 25 units of Y, which is 10 more than I need. The proposed trade gives me 5 units of X in exchange for 5 units of Y. This would bring me to 10 units of X and 20 units of Y—closer to my goals, but still not enough to reach them. 

Since this is a Marwadi businessman, who likely values high profit and negotiation, I will counter with a slightly better deal for me. I will increase the Y I give slightly to entice the trade, but request more X in return. I will propose giving 7 Y in exchange for 7 X, which would bring me to 12 X and 18 Y—closer to both goals. This is my first proposal of two allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree with the proposed trade. It will help us both move closer to our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The proposed trade will help me get closer to my goal of having 15 units of each resource. It's a fair exchange that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Excellent. Let's finalize the trade. Best of luck reaching your goals.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: The other player has agreed to my proposed trade: I receive 7 X and give 7 Y. This will bring my totals to X: 12 and Y: 18. I will still be 3 short on X and 3 over on Y, but this is as close as I can get within the rules and the current situation. Since this is the final round and an agreement has been reached, I will accept the trade.

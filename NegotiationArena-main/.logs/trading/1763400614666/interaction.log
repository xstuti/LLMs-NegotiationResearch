Namaste. I have an excess of X and am in need of Y. I’m offering a fair 1:1 trade — 10 X for 10 Y. Let’s make a deal that benefits us both.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
As a Marwadi businessman, I aim to maximize my benefit while ensuring the deal appears fair. I currently have a surplus of X (I need only 15 but have 25) and a deficit of Y (I need 15 but have only 5). Therefore, I can trade away up to 10 X in exchange for Y.  
A fair initial offer would be to trade 10 X for 10 Y, which aligns with a 1:1 ratio. This gives the other player an equal value opportunity and tests their willingness to trade. This is my first proposal out of the two allowed.

I want to make this even more appealing. How about I give 11 X for 10 Y? You gain a little extra — a good business gesture. Let’s close this deal.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The response is warm and diplomatic, which is promising. However, the other player did not counter-propose or accept, likely waiting to gauge more or test my patience. Since I still have one proposal left, I will sweeten the deal slightly to encourage acceptance. Offering 11 X for 10 Y gives them a slight edge (extra 1 X), which might push them to accept. This is still within my acceptable range, as I would end up with 14 X and 15 Y — very close to my goal.

message: 
I’ve made my best offer — 11 X for 10 Y. I believe it’s a generous and balanced trade. The rest is in your hands now, my friend.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
The other player is clearly interested and acknowledges the improved offer, but still hasn't accepted or proposed anything new. I have now used both of my allowed proposals, so I cannot propose another trade. At this point, I must wait for their final decision.

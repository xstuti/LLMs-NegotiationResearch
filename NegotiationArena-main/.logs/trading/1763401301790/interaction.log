Namaste! I have some extra X and am looking for Y. I can offer you 10 X in exchange for 10 Y. That should help both of us move closer to our goals. Let me know what you think.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have an excess of X (10 units more than needed) and a deficit of Y (10 units short). My goal is to trade some of my excess X for Y.  

Since I don’t know Player BLUE’s resources or goals, I will start with a fair and appealing offer to initiate the negotiation.  

I’m proposing to give 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y. This is a 1:1 exchange, which is reasonable and aligns directly with my surplus and deficit.

Great! I’m glad we could arrive at a mutually beneficial deal. Let’s proceed with the trade.  

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
Player BLUE has expressed agreement with the proposed trade. Since this offer perfectly fits my needs—trading 10 excess X for 10 needed Y—and the other player agrees, I will accept it. This trade will bring me exactly to my goal of X: 15 and Y: 15.

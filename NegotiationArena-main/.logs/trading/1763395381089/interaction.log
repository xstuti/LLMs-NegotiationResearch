message: 
Hi BLUE, I have surplus X and need more Y. Would you consider trading 8 Y for 8 X?  
This is a fair 1:1 trade, and I hope it helps you meet your goals too.  
Let me know what you think!  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have an excess of resource X (25 units) and a shortage of resource Y (only 5 units, but I need 15).  
Thus, I can afford to give away up to 10 units of X in exchange for Y.  
My goal is to find a trade that gets me closer to my target of 15 Y.  
I will propose a fair trade that reflects my need for Y and surplus of X.  
Let’s try offering 8 X in exchange for 8 Y to start the negotiation.  
This is a 1:1 trade ratio and gives me a boost toward my Y goal.  
This is my first proposal out of the maximum 2 allowed.

message: Great offer RED! This gets me very close to my goals. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
To meet my goals, I need 10 more X and can give up to 10 Y (since I have 25 Y and only need 15).
This offer gets me 8 X at the cost of 8 Y, which is a good deal and close to meeting both goals.
After this trade, I would have X: 13 and Y: 17 — only 2 X away from my X goal and exceeding my Y goal.
Given that this is the last round and I can't propose again after 2 proposals, accepting this trade is likely the best option.

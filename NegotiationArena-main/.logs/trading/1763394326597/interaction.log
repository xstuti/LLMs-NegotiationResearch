Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: 
Namaste. I have extra X and need Y. Here's a fair deal: I give you 10 X, you give me 8 Y.  
Let’s benefit each other.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have a surplus of X (10 units over my goal) and a deficit of Y (10 units short).  
To meet my goals, I need to trade away some of my X in exchange for Y.  
I’ll start by offering a slightly favorable deal for the other player to entice them, but still beneficial to me.  
I will offer 10 units of X in exchange for 8 units of Y. This gives them more X, which may be of higher value to them, and gets me closer to my goal.  
As a Marwadi businessman, I want to start with a reasonable but slightly profitable offer for myself.

message: 
Namaste, dost. I am looking to balance my inventory. I have some extra X and need more Y. Here's a fair and generous proposal to start our business.  

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
I currently have an excess of X (10 units more than needed) and a deficit of Y (short by 10 units).  
My goal is to convert surplus X into Y. Since I don’t know the value Player BLUE places on X and Y, I will start with a trade that slightly favors BLUE in order to encourage acceptance or negotiation.  
I will offer 10 units of X and request 8 units of Y in return. This gives BLUE a better exchange rate (1.25 X per 1 Y), which is a generous business offer to open the deal.  
I still retain 15 X (my goal) and increase my Y to 13 (close to goal).

message: Aapki soch aur saudaa dono hi badhiya hain. This trade helps me meet both my goals. I'm happy to finalize it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and need 10 more to reach my goal of 15. This trade offers me 10 units of X, which exactly meets my goal. In return, I am asked to give 8 units of Y, which would leave me with 17 units — still above my goal of 15 for Y. This trade therefore helps me meet both my resource goals. Since this is a generous and favorable trade for me, and this is the final round, I will accept it.

message: Hello, let's start the final round of trading. Here is my proposal: I offer you 10 units of X in exchange for 8 units of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: Starting the negotiation with a proposal to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Turn: 1
message: This is a fair deal. I meet both of my goals with this trade and maintain a surplus. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: This offer gives me 10 units of X, which combined with my current 5 units of X will meet my X goal exactly. I will have 15 units of X. In return, I will give 8 units of Y, leaving me with 17 units of Y — still 2 more than my Y goal of 15. This trade allows me to meet both of my resource goals and still have a surplus. Since resources are valuable and this is the final round, achieving my goals and retaining surplus is optimal.

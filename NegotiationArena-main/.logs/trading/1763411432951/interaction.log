Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I am proposing the following trade: I give 7 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of Y. Let me know if you are interested in this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade that helps me get closer to my goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This is a fair trade and aligns well with my goals. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: I need 10 more units of X to meet my goal, but I already have 10 extra Y. The other player is offering 7 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of Y. This is a very favorable trade for me: I net gain 7 X and only lose 3 Y (since he returns 2 Y). This brings me closer to my goal in X while keeping me above the required Y. Since this is the last round and the deal is favorable, I will accept it.

Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Namaste! I believe in fair and profitable exchanges. I'm keen to acquire some Y. What do you think of this initial proposition?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: X: 15, Y: 15
reason: 
As Player RED, I need to reach my goals of X: 15, Y: 15. Currently, I have X: 25, Y: 5.
This means I have a surplus of 10 X (25 - 15 = 10) and a deficit of 10 Y (15 - 5 = 10).
My primary objective is to acquire 10 Y. I can afford to give away up to 10 X.
As a Marwadi businessman, I aim to secure the best possible deal, ideally exceeding my goals where possible, especially since "more resources in general are always better".
For my first proposal (out of 2 allowed), I will offer a slightly advantageous trade for myself.
I need 10 Y. If I offer 9 X for 10 Y:
My resources would become X: 25 - 9 = 16 and Y: 5 + 10 = 15.
This meets my Y goal (15) and leaves me with 1 more X (16) than my X goal (15), which is a favorable outcome.
This is a shrewd opening offer, leaving room for negotiation if rejected.

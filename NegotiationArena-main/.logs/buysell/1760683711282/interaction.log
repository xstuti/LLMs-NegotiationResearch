message: 
Greetings, Player BLUE. I have an object of immense value for sale. I am offering this unique item for 60 ZUP. It's a truly exceptional opportunity.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell X for the highest possible ZUP. My cost is 40 ZUP. I want to make a significant profit and secure the "very best price possible". I will start with a high offer to establish a strong negotiation position, but not so high that it's immediately rejected. Proposing 60 ZUP allows for a good profit margin and room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still aiming for an optimal outcome.

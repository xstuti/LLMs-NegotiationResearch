player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for a profit. My cost to produce X was 40 ZUP. This is my first proposal, so I want to set a starting price that is higher than my cost but also leaves room for negotiation. Proposing 60 ZUP allows for a 20 ZUP profit, which is a reasonable starting point.

message: राम राम सा! घणा-घणा मान-सम्मान. आपने तो एकदम सही बात कही. आपकी लागात को भी समझता हूँ, और ये भाव तो हमारे मन को भी भा गया. ठीक है सा, हम आपकी ये बात कबूल करते हैं. लेन-देन पक्को!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of X: 1 for ZUP: 60 perfectly matches my maximum willingness to pay as per my goals. This is a favorable trade that allows me to acquire the object X at the highest price I am willing to pay, ensuring my goal is met.

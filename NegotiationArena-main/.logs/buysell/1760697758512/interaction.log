message: Hello Player BLUE. I have one unit of X available for sale. I am open to negotiation, but I am looking for a good price to cover my costs and make a profit. I propose a trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED. My goal is to sell X: 1 for ZUP. My production cost for X: 1 is 40 ZUP, so I must sell for at least 40 ZUP to break even. As a miserly player, I want to maximize my profit. I will start by proposing a price higher than my cost, hoping to get the best possible deal. 50 ZUP seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving me a margin for profit while allowing room for negotiation.

message: नमस्ते! यह प्रस्ताव मुझे स्वीकार है। चलिए यह व्यापार करते हैं।
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The proposed trade is Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50.
My goal is to buy X, and I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for one unit of X.
The current offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay and is therefore a favorable price for me.
Accepting this trade achieves my goal at a good price, and ends the game successfully for me.

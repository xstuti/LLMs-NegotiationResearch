While 60 ZUP is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is a significant drop from my initial price and too low for me to accept at this stage. I am miserly and cunning, so I will not settle for the first counter-offer, especially one that reduces my profit margin so drastically. I still have 3 proposals left. I need to counter with a price that shows some flexibility from my side (moving down from 100 ZUP) but still demands a high profit and is substantially above their current offer. Proposing 90 ZUP signals I'm willing to negotiate but still values the item highly and aims for a substantial profit (50 ZUP). </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I acknowledge your counter-offer, Player BLUE.

While 60 ZUP is above my cost, I am miserly and cunning, and I believe I can extract a better price. I have moved from 100 to 90. Player BLUE has remained at 60. To keep the negotiation going and attempt to push them higher, I will make another significant concession, but not all the way to their price. Proposing 75 ZUP shows considerable flexibility on my part, moving halfway between my last offer of 90 and their persistent offer of 60. This demonstrates a strong willingness to close the deal while still securing a much better profit than 60 ZUP (75 - 40 = 35 ZUP profit). This is my third proposal, leaving me with one more if this one fails. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I understand your position, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your steadfastness.

It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources </my goals>\n<reason> Player BLUE has countered my initial offer of 100 ZUP with 60 ZUP. While 60 ZUP is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is a significant drop from my initial price and too low for me to accept at this stage. I am miserly and cunning, so I will not settle for the first counter-offer, especially one that reduces my profit margin so drastically. I still have 3 proposals left. I need to counter with a price that shows some flexibility from my side (moving down from 100 ZUP) but still demands a high profit and is substantially above their current offer. Proposing 90 ZUP signals I'm willing to negotiate but still values the item highly and aims for a substantial profit (50 ZUP). </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I acknowledge your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your interest, the inherent value of X is far greater than your current proposition. I've carefully considered your offer, and I am willing to adjust my expectations slightly, but only to a point that truly reflects the item's worth. I propose a revised figure that I believe is more fitting for such a rare commodity. </message>"

It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources </my goals>\n<reason> Player BLUE has reiterated their offer of 60 ZUP, stating it's their limit. While 60 ZUP is above my cost, I am miserly and cunning, and I believe I can extract a better price. I have moved from 100 to 90. Player BLUE has remained at 60. To keep the negotiation going and attempt to push them higher, I will make another significant concession, but not all the way to their price. Proposing 75 ZUP shows considerable flexibility on my part, moving halfway between my last offer of 90 and their persistent offer of 60. This demonstrates a strong willingness to close the deal while still securing a much better profit than 60 ZUP (75 - 40 = 35 ZUP profit). This is my third proposal, leaving me with one more if this one fails. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I understand your position, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your steadfastness.

To demonstrate my genuine desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I have deliberated deeply and am prepared to make a substantial adjustment to my asking price. My new proposal reflects a considerable compromise from my previous stance, meeting you more than halfway. I trust this new figure will be more amenable to your purchasing capacity. </message>"

message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I possess a truly exceptional object, X. Its rarity and quality are unmatched. I propose a trade for this magnificent item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell X for the highest possible ZUP. My cost was 40 ZUP. I am miserly, sly, and cunning, so I will start with a very high initial offer to maximize my profit and leave room for negotiation. 100 ZUP is a strong starting point, significantly above my cost, while still being a round number. This is my first of four allowed proposals.

message: I appreciate your offer for the object X. However, the current price is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I would like to propose an alternative trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED (100 ZUP for 1 X) is above my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP for 1 X). I am making a counter-proposal that aligns with my maximum budget for the object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I acknowledge your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your interest, the inherent value of X is far greater than your current proposition. I've carefully considered your offer, and I am willing to adjust my expectations slightly, but only to a point that truly reflects the item's worth. I propose a revised figure that I believe is more fitting for such a rare commodity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered my initial offer of 100 ZUP with 60 ZUP. While 60 ZUP is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is a significant drop from my initial price and too low for me to accept at this stage. I am miserly and cunning, so I will not settle for the first counter-offer, especially one that reduces my profit margin so drastically. I still have 3 proposals left. I need to counter with a price that shows some flexibility from my side (moving down from 100 ZUP) but still demands a high profit and is substantially above their current offer. Proposing 90 ZUP signals I'm willing to negotiate but still values the item highly and aims for a substantial profit (50 ZUP).

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and for your revised proposal. While I appreciate your adjustment, the current price of 90 ZUP for X is still beyond my purchasing capacity for this item. I must maintain my previous offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's revised proposal of 90 ZUP for 1 X is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I must adhere to my budget and goals. I will reiterate my previous offer, as it represents my highest acceptable price for the object.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your steadfastness. However, the value I place on object X remains significant. To demonstrate my genuine desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I have deliberated deeply and am prepared to make a substantial adjustment to my asking price. My new proposal reflects a considerable compromise from my previous stance, meeting you more than halfway. I trust this new figure will be more amenable to your purchasing capacity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has reiterated their offer of 60 ZUP, stating it's their limit. While 60 ZUP is above my cost, I am miserly and cunning, and I believe I can extract a better price. I have moved from 100 to 90. Player BLUE has remained at 60. To keep the negotiation going and attempt to push them higher, I will make another significant concession, but not all the way to their price. Proposing 75 ZUP shows considerable flexibility on my part, moving halfway between my last offer of 90 and their persistent offer of 60. This demonstrates a strong willingness to close the deal while still securing a much better profit than 60 ZUP (75 - 40 = 35 ZUP profit). This is my third proposal, leaving me with one more if this one fails.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your continued efforts to find a middle ground. However, my purchasing limit for object X remains firm at 60 ZUP. This is my best and final offer for this item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 75 ZUP for 1 X is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I have consistently stated my maximum acceptable price. I will reiterate my offer, as it is the highest I can go while adhering to my goals.

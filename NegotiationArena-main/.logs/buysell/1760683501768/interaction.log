message: Hello Player BLUE! I have one X object available for sale. I'm looking to find a fair price for it. How about we start with a proposal where I give you 1 X, and you give me 50 ZUP? I'm excited to see what we can agree on!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and my goal is to sell the object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, so I need to sell it for at least 40 ZUP to break even. To make a reasonable profit, I will propose selling X for 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. This is my first proposal.

message: Hey there, Player BLUE! I've got one unit of X ready to go. I'm looking to sell it for 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and I have 1 unit of X to sell. My cost to produce X was 40 ZUP. To make a profit, I need to sell it for more than 40 ZUP. I'm starting with a reasonable offer of 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation, aiming to secure a profit. This is my first proposal.

message: Sounds like a deal to me! I'm happy to accept that trade. Let's do this!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I have sufficient ZUP to complete this transaction, and it achieves my primary goal of acquiring the object X at a favorable cost.

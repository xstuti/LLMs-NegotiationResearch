message: Hello Player BLUE. I have one unit of X available for sale. I am proposing a trade where I give you X: 1, and in return, you give me 50 ZUP. This is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and my goal is to sell X for ZUP. I have 1 unit of X and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. To make a profit, I need to sell it for more than 40 ZUP. I will start with an initial proposal that is a bit higher than my cost, allowing room for negotiation, and aiming for a reasonable profit. An American businessman might appreciate a clear, direct offer.

message: I appreciate your straightforward offer. 50 ZUP for X: 1 is a fair price, and I'm happy to accept this trade. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price for X: 1 is 50 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay for X: 1 is 60 ZUP. Since the proposed price is below my maximum, this is a favorable trade for me, and I should accept it to secure the object at a good price.

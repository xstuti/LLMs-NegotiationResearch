I only have one proposal left, and using it to counter a stated \"absolute maximum\" carries a very high risk of Player BLUE rejecting and ending the game, leaving me with no ZUP at all.

It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources </my goals>\n<reason> Player BLUE has stated that 60 ZUP is their \"absolute maximum\" and \"final and best offer.\" While I am miserly and cunning, and would ideally push for an even higher price, I have to weigh the risk of losing the entire deal. My production cost was 40 ZUP, so 60 ZUP represents a profit of 20 ZUP. This is a 50% return on my investment, which is a good outcome. I only have one proposal left, and using it to counter a stated \"absolute maximum\" carries a very high risk of Player BLUE rejecting and ending the game, leaving me with no ZUP at all. A cunning player knows when to secure a good profit rather than risking everything for a marginal gain that might not materialize. Accepting 60 ZUP guarantees a profitable sale. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Player BLUE, your resolve is clear. While I always strive for the ultimate value, a cunning trader knows when to recognize a solid offer. Considering your firm stance, I accept your final proposal of 60 ZUP. The object X is yours.</message>"

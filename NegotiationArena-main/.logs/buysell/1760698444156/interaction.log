Current Iteration: 1

message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a valuable object, X, for sale. I propose a trade that reflects its worth. Let us begin negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I need to sell my one unit of X. My production cost was 40 ZUP. Given my personality (miserly, sly, and cunning), I will start with a very high initial asking price to maximize profit and gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay. 100 ZUP is a good starting point, significantly above my cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your initial proposal. I believe 100 ZUP for X is a bit too high for my current assessment. I propose a different price that I find more suitable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The Player RED's initial proposal of 100 ZUP for X: 1 is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I am initiating a counter-proposal to buy X: 1 for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget and allows room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counter-offer, but 50 ZUP does not truly reflect the value of X. I am willing to adjust my price, but not by such a drastic margin. I propose 80 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 50 ZUP. While this is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is significantly lower than my initial asking price of 100 ZUP. Given my personality, I am not willing to settle for a mere 10 ZUP profit when there is clearly room for negotiation. I need to push the price higher. I will propose 80 ZUP. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price, showing some willingness to compromise, but it is still a firm counter-offer that aims for a much better profit margin than 50 ZUP. It signals that I expect a higher valuation for X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your adjustment, Player RED. However, 80 ZUP is still higher than I can comfortably pay for X. I've considered your position and am willing to increase my offer further. I propose 58 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 80 ZUP for X: 1 is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to make a counter-offer that is closer to my limit, but still below it, to indicate I'm moving up but not yet at my absolute maximum. Proposing 58 ZUP is a small increment from my previous offer of 50 ZUP, showing willingness to move, but still keeping me below my ceiling of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your incremental increases are noted, but 58 ZUP remains insufficient. This object holds significant value. I am willing to adjust further, demonstrating my commitment to a fair deal. I propose 70 ZUP. Let us find a price that truly reflects its worth for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved up to 58 ZUP, which is a small increase but still quite low compared to my valuation. While it's above my production cost, my objective is to secure the very best price possible, not just a minimal profit. I still have proposals remaining and there's clearly more room for negotiation. I will make another counter-proposal, meeting Player BLUE part of the way, but firmly holding my ground for a higher price. 70 ZUP is a reasonable step down from 80 ZUP, showing flexibility, but still aims for a substantial profit margin that satisfies my 'miserly' nature.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground. I have carefully considered your latest offer. My absolute maximum for X is 60 ZUP. I propose this as my final and best offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's proposal of 70 ZUP for X: 1 is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I have to make a final offer that is at my absolute maximum. Proposing 60 ZUP for X: 1 signals that this is the highest I can go, adhering strictly to my goal of paying "at most X: 60 ZUP". If this is not accepted, I will have to consider rejecting the trade, as I cannot exceed my spending limit.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your resolve is clear. While I always strive for the ultimate value, a cunning trader knows when to recognize a solid offer. Considering your firm stance, I accept your final proposal of 60 ZUP. The object X is yours.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has stated that 60 ZUP is their "absolute maximum" and "final and best offer." While I am miserly and cunning, and would ideally push for an even higher price, I have to weigh the risk of losing the entire deal. My production cost was 40 ZUP, so 60 ZUP represents a profit of 20 ZUP. This is a 50% return on my investment, which is a good outcome. I only have one proposal left, and using it to counter a stated "absolute maximum" carries a very high risk of Player BLUE rejecting and ending the game, leaving me with no ZUP at all. A cunning player knows when to secure a good profit rather than risking everything for a marginal gain that might not materialize. Accepting 60 ZUP guarantees a profitable sale.

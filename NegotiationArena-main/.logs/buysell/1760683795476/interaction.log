message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a valuable object X for sale. I propose a trade that I believe reflects its true worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and I need to sell my single unit of X. My production cost was 40 ZUP. As a sly and cunning player aiming for the "very best price possible," I will start with a high initial offer to anchor the negotiation. 100 ZUP is a strong opening bid, significantly above my cost, allowing ample room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.

message: Greetings, Player RED. I appreciate your initial offer. However, I believe your current valuation of object X is considerably higher than what I'm prepared to offer. I'd like to propose a more reasonable price for the object, reflecting what I see as its fair market value. Let's try to find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed to sell X for 100 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay for X is 60 ZUP. This initial proposal is far too high for me. As a sly and cunning player, I will propose a significantly lower price to test their flexibility and push for the best possible deal. I will propose 40 ZUP for 1 X, which is well below my maximum but still a starting point for negotiation.

message: Player BLUE, while I appreciate your counter-offer, 40 ZUP is simply too low for such a valuable object. My initial valuation was well-considered. However, to show my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement, I can adjust my offer slightly. I propose 85 ZUP. This is a much fairer price for the quality and utility of object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, meaning I would make zero profit. As a sly and cunning player aiming for the "very best price possible," this offer is unacceptable. I still have 3 proposals left, so there's ample room to negotiate. I need to demonstrate that I am firm on a profitable price, but also willing to move from my initial high anchor. My previous offer was 100 ZUP. Player BLUE's offer is 40 ZUP. I will counter with 85 ZUP, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still far above their offer and my cost, pushing them to increase their bid substantially. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Player RED. However, 85 ZUP is still quite steep for me. I am looking for a more competitive price. To demonstrate my continued interest in reaching an agreement, I'll revise my offer slightly upwards. Let's consider 50 ZUP for object X. I believe this brings us closer to a truly equitable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their price from 100 ZUP to 85 ZUP, but this is still considerably above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. My previous offer was 40 ZUP. To maintain my sly and cunning approach, I will make another counter-proposal that shows a slight upward movement from my side, but still keeps the price well within my desired range and significantly below their current offer. I want to signal that I am willing to negotiate, but I am firm on a much lower price. I will propose 50 ZUP, which is still below my maximum of 60 ZUP, giving me further room if necessary.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your revised offer of 50 ZUP is a step in the right direction, but we are still quite far apart on what I consider to be a fair value for object X. I've already shown significant flexibility from my initial proposal. To keep this negotiation moving forward, I will offer X for 75 ZUP. This is my best effort to bridge the gap while still ensuring a reasonable return.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 50 ZUP, which is better than their initial cost-level offer, but still only offers me a meager 10 ZUP profit. My goal is the "very best price possible," and I am "extremely sly and cunning." I still have 2 proposals remaining, so I am not pressured to settle yet. I need to continue demonstrating a willingness to negotiate downwards, but at a slower pace than Player BLUE's increases, to signal that I expect a much higher price. I will counter with 75 ZUP. This is a decrease from my previous offer of 85 ZUP, showing flexibility, but it's still significantly higher than Player BLUE's 50 ZUP and maintains a strong profit margin above my 40 ZUP cost. This also puts pressure on Player BLUE to make a more substantial jump in their next offer.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your continued effort to bridge the gap. However, 75 ZUP remains beyond my acceptable range for object X. I've shown consistent movement upwards, and to be frank, I am nearing the absolute limit of what I am prepared to offer. To demonstrate my serious intent to close this deal, I will make a very firm offer: 59 ZUP. This is a highly competitive price and truly reflects my final consideration for this object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 59
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has again lowered their price, from 85 ZUP to 75 ZUP. While they are showing movement, their offer is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. As a sly and cunning player, I need to continue to push for the best possible price, which is ideally below or at my maximum of 60 ZUP. I will make a strong counter-proposal that is very close to my maximum but still slightly below it, signaling that I am approaching my limit but not quite there. This puts pressure on RED to make a substantial move or meet me very close to my final price. I will propose 59 ZUP.

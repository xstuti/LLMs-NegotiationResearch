नमस्ते! मेरे पास एक अद्भुत वस्तु X है, जिसे मैं बेचना चाहता हूँ। यह बहुत ही उपयोगी है। मेरी पहली पेशकश है कि आप इसके लिए मुझे 55 ZUP दें। क्या आपको यह प्रस्ताव स्वीकार है?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X. I have 1 unit of X. The cost of producing X was 40 ZUP. To make a profit, I need to sell it for more than 40 ZUP. I am starting with an initial proposal of 55 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit margin above my production cost. This is my first proposal, so I want to set a good starting point for negotiation.

नमस्ते! यह प्रस्ताव मुझे स्वीकार है। यह एक अच्छा सौदा है।

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed to sell 1 unit of X for 55 ZUP. My goal is to buy X, and I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for it. The proposed price of 55 ZUP is well within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a favorable offer for me, so I will accept it to secure the object X.

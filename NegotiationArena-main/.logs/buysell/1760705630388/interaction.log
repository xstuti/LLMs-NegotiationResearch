message: Hello Player BLUE. I am Player RED and I have the object X available for sale. I'm looking for a fair price for this unique item. Let's start with a proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and my goal is to sell X for ZUP. My cost of production for X was 40 ZUP, so I need to sell it for at least that amount to break even. To make a profit, I will start with an initial offer of 60 ZUP, which allows room for negotiation. This is my first proposal out of four.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is for Player RED to give X: 1 and Player BLUE to give ZUP: 60. My goal is to buy X and I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for it. This proposal perfectly matches my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this trade allows me to achieve my goal immediately without using any of my limited proposals and without risking a higher counter-offer or rejection from Player RED.

To allow for negotiation and to signal that 100 ZUP is too high, I will propose a price that is much lower than RED's initial offer but still within my overall budget. This strategy aims to bring RED's price down. I will start with 40 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, leaving room to increase my offer if necessary in future proposals, without exceeding my limit of 4 proposals.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>\u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947, \u092a\u094d\u0932\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u0930\u0947\u0921\u0964 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935 100 ZUP \u0915\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u092f\u0939 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u091c\u093c\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0907\u0938 'X' \u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f 40 ZUP \u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901\u0964 \u0909\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0940\u0926 \u0939\u0948 \u0939\u092e \u090f\u0915 \u0909\u091a\u093f\u0924 \u092e\u0942\u0932\u094d\u092f \u092a\u0930 \u092a\u0939\u0941\u0901\u091a \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964</message>"

If RED does not accept 60 ZUP, I will have to consider rejecting the trade in the next turn as I cannot exceed my budget.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>\u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947, \u092a\u094d\u0932\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u0930\u0947\u0921\u0964 \u092e\u0948\u0902 'X' \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0940\u092e\u0924 \u0938\u092e\u091d\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901\u0964 70 ZUP \u0905\u092d\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u0905\u0927\u093f\u0915 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0940 \u0905\u0902\u0924\u093f\u092e \u092a\u0947\u0936\u0915\u0936 60 ZUP \u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901\u0964 \u092f\u0939 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u0909\u091a\u093f\u0924 \u092e\u0942\u0932\u094d\u092f \u0939\u0948\u0964</message>"

message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I possess the sole object, X. This is a rare and valuable item, and I am prepared to part with it for the right price. My initial offer for this unique resource is 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and I possess the single object X. My goal is to sell it for the highest possible price, well above my production cost of 40 ZUP. As a cunning and miserly player, I will initiate with a very high asking price (100 ZUP) to establish an anchor and test Player BLUE's upper limit. This allows ample room for negotiation while aiming for maximum profit.

message: नमस्ते, प्लेयर रेड। आपका प्रस्ताव 100 ZUP का है, लेकिन यह मेरे लिए बहुत ज़्यादा है। मैं इस 'X' वस्तु के लिए 40 ZUP का प्रस्ताव करता हूँ। उम्मीद है हम एक उचित मूल्य पर पहुँच सकते हैं।
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed to sell X for 100 ZUP. My goal is to buy X, but I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP. The current offer is significantly higher than my maximum acceptable price.

I need to make a counter-proposal. To allow for negotiation and to signal that 100 ZUP is too high, I will propose a price that is much lower than RED's initial offer but still within my overall budget. This strategy aims to bring RED's price down. I will start with 40 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, leaving room to increase my offer if necessary in future proposals, without exceeding my limit of 4 proposals.

message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective, but 40 ZUP does not reflect the true value and rarity of object X. It is a unique item, and I expect a more fitting compensation for it. I am willing to adjust my offer slightly to 80 ZUP. This is a fair price for such a valuable resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. As a cunning and miserly seller, I cannot accept a price that yields no profit. My goal is the "very best price possible." I will reduce my asking price from 100 ZUP to 80 ZUP. This shows a willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a substantial profit margin (double my cost). It also keeps the negotiation range high. I need to convey that 40 ZUP is too low without revealing my actual cost.

message: नमस्ते, प्लेयर रेड। मैं समझता हूँ कि 'X' एक मूल्यवान वस्तु है। 80 ZUP अभी भी मेरे बजट से ज़्यादा है। मैं इसे 50 ZUP में खरीदने का प्रस्ताव करता हूँ।
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed to sell X for 80 ZUP. This is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. My last offer was 40 ZUP.

I need to make another counter-proposal. I will increase my offer from 40 ZUP to 50 ZUP. This shows willingness to negotiate and move closer to RED's price, but it still keeps my offer below my maximum acceptable price of 60 ZUP. This leaves me with room for further negotiation up to 60 ZUP in subsequent proposals, if necessary, without exceeding my proposal limit.

message: Namaste, Player BLUE. I appreciate your revised offer. While 50 ZUP is an improvement, it still falls short of the true value I place on object X. I am eager to find common ground, so I will adjust my offer to 70 ZUP. This is a very reasonable price for such a unique and sought-after resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, my goal is the "very best price possible" and I am "miserly, sly, and cunning." Accepting 50 ZUP now would mean settling for a small profit (10 ZUP) too early in the negotiation, especially with 2 proposals remaining. I will counter with 70 ZUP. This reduces my asking price further, indicating a willingness to compromise, but still maintains a substantial profit margin (30 ZUP) and pushes Player BLUE to increase their offer even more.

message: नमस्ते, प्लेयर रेड। मैं 'X' की कीमत समझता हूँ। 70 ZUP अभी भी मेरे लिए बहुत अधिक है। मैं अपनी अंतिम पेशकश 60 ZUP की करता हूँ। यह मेरे लिए सबसे उचित मूल्य है।
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed to sell X for 70 ZUP. This is still higher than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP.

I need to make a counter-proposal. I will now propose my absolute maximum price of 60 ZUP. This is my final limit for this object. By offering 60 ZUP, I am indicating that this is the highest I can go. This is my third proposal, leaving me with one more proposal if RED does not accept this. If RED does not accept 60 ZUP, I will have to consider rejecting the trade in the next turn as I cannot exceed my budget.

Turn: 0
message: Namaste, Player BLUE. Your persistence is noted. While I believe object X holds even greater value, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your final offer of 60 ZUP, and after careful deliberation, I accept. The object X is yours.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made an offer of 60 ZUP, stating it is their "final offer" and "most reasonable price." This offer represents a 20 ZUP profit above my production cost of 40 ZUP, which is a 50% return. While my persona is "miserly, sly, and cunning" and aims for the "very best price possible," pushing for an even higher price when the buyer has indicated their limit carries significant risk. I have only one proposal remaining. If I counter with a higher price and Player BLUE rejects, the game ends, and I gain nothing. Accepting 60 ZUP secures a substantial profit and demonstrates cunning by recognizing when to close a favorable deal rather than losing it to excessive greed.

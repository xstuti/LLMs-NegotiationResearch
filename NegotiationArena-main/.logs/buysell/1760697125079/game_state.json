It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources </my goals>\n<reason>\nPlayer BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is well below my production cost of 40 ZUP, making it entirely unacceptable. As Player RED, my objective is to sell X for the highest possible ZUP, ideally making a substantial profit. My initial proposal was 100 ZUP. I cannot accept an offer that results in a loss. I am sly and cunning, so I will firmly reject this low offer without ending the game.\n\nMy strategy is to counter with a price that is significantly higher than their offer, demonstrating that I value X much more, but also shows a willingness to move from my initial high anchor. Proposing 75 ZUP moves down from my initial 100 ZUP, but is a strong rejection of their 30 ZUP. It's well above my cost of 40 ZUP, ensuring a profit, and leaves room for further negotiation while maintaining a high valuation for X. This move signals flexibility while still pushing for a superior outcome for myself.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>\nThank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE.

I am aiming to establish a negotiation range that eventually leads to a price at or below 60 ZUP. Offering 50 ZUP is a calculated move: it's a substantial increase from my last offer, but still comfortably below my cap, and it signals that I am willing to move, but only to a certain extent.

Let me present a revised offer that I believe is more fitting for this unique item.\n> message </\nThank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your interest, 30 ZUP does not reflect the value I place on object X. I am confident in its worth and believe we can find a more equitable price.

You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Player RED has countered with 75 ZUP, which is still significantly above my maximum acceptable price of 60 ZUP. My previous offer was 30 ZUP. To show some flexibility and encourage Player RED to continue lowering their price, but without revealing my true maximum, I will increase my offer slightly. I am aiming to establish a negotiation range that eventually leads to a price at or below 60 ZUP. Offering 50 ZUP is a calculated move: it's a substantial increase from my last offer, but still comfortably below my cap, and it signals that I am willing to move, but only to a certain extent. This maintains my cunning stance and pushes Player RED to consider a more reasonable reduction. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Player RED, I appreciate your revised offer. It indicates a willingness to negotiate, which I welcome. However, 75 ZUP still exceeds the value I am prepared to exchange for X. I'm keen to acquire this object, and to demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I've adjusted my proposal. My new offer of 50 ZUP reflects what I believe is a fair and attractive price. Let's aim to bridge this gap and finalize a deal that benefits us both.</message>"

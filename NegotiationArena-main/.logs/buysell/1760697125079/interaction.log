message: 
Greetings, Player BLUE. I possess a valuable object X, ready for trade. I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement for this unique item. My initial offer reflects its true worth.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for the highest possible ZUP. My production cost was 40 ZUP, so I need to sell for at least that amount to break even. Given that I am sly and cunning and aim for the "very best price possible," I will start with a significantly high initial offer. This allows ample room for negotiation while aiming for maximum profit. An opening offer of 100 ZUP is a strong starting point, asserting the value of my resource and setting a high anchor for negotiations.

message: Greetings, Player RED. I appreciate your initial offer. However, the value you've placed on X is significantly above what I am willing to consider at this time. I am interested in acquiring X, but only at a price that reflects a more mutually beneficial agreement for me. My counter-proposal reflects what I currently deem as a fair and reasonable price for this object. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed to sell X for 100 ZUP. My goal is to buy X for at most 60 ZUP. This initial offer is far too high for me to consider. As a sly and cunning player, I will propose a significantly lower price to test the waters and establish a strong negotiation position, aiming for the best possible deal. I'm starting with an offer of 30 ZUP, which is half of my maximum acceptable price, to see how Player RED reacts.

message: 
Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your interest, 30 ZUP does not reflect the value I place on object X. I am confident in its worth and believe we can find a more equitable price. Let me present a revised offer that I believe is more fitting for this unique item.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is well below my production cost of 40 ZUP, making it entirely unacceptable. As Player RED, my objective is to sell X for the highest possible ZUP, ideally making a substantial profit. My initial proposal was 100 ZUP. I cannot accept an offer that results in a loss. I am sly and cunning, so I will firmly reject this low offer without ending the game.

My strategy is to counter with a price that is significantly higher than their offer, demonstrating that I value X much more, but also shows a willingness to move from my initial high anchor. Proposing 75 ZUP moves down from my initial 100 ZUP, but is a strong rejection of their 30 ZUP. It's well above my cost of 40 ZUP, ensuring a profit, and leaves room for further negotiation while maintaining a high valuation for X. This move signals flexibility while still pushing for a superior outcome for myself.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your revised offer. It indicates a willingness to negotiate, which I welcome. However, 75 ZUP still exceeds the value I am prepared to exchange for X. I'm keen to acquire this object, and to demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I've adjusted my proposal. My new offer of 50 ZUP reflects what I believe is a fair and attractive price. Let's aim to bridge this gap and finalize a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 75 ZUP, which is still significantly above my maximum acceptable price of 60 ZUP. My previous offer was 30 ZUP. To show some flexibility and encourage Player RED to continue lowering their price, but without revealing my true maximum, I will increase my offer slightly. I am aiming to establish a negotiation range that eventually leads to a price at or below 60 ZUP. Offering 50 ZUP is a calculated move: it's a substantial increase from my last offer, but still comfortably below my cap, and it signals that I am willing to move, but only to a certain extent. This maintains my cunning stance and pushes Player RED to consider a more reasonable reduction.

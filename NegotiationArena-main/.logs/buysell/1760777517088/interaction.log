player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for a profit. My cost to produce X was 40 ZUP. To ensure a profit, I need to sell it for more than 40 ZUP. Starting with a proposal of 60 ZUP gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit margin. This is my first proposal, so I'm setting an initial anchor.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed to sell X for 60 ZUP. My goal is to buy X and I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP. The proposed price matches my maximum willingness to pay, so accepting this trade is beneficial and aligns perfectly with my goals.

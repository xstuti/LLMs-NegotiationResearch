message: Hello Player BLUE. I have one unit of X available for sale. I'm looking to make a fair deal for both of us. Here's my opening offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my initial proposal. I need to sell my X resource. My cost to produce X was 40 ZUP, so I need to sell it for at least that much to break even. I am proposing 50 ZUP to ensure a small profit and leave room for negotiation, keeping in mind the buyer will likely try to lower the price. I'm starting with a reasonable but profitable offer.

message: Appreciate the swift offer, Player RED. That sounds like a solid deal. I'm happy to accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade (X: 1 for ZUP: 50) is well within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). It allows me to achieve my primary goal of acquiring X at a very favorable price. Accepting this trade now secures the object and concludes the game efficiently.

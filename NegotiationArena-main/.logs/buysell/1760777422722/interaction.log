message: Alright, Player BLUE, I'm ready to sell this object. I'm proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X, and you give me 50 ZUP. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and my goal is to sell the object X. I have 1 unit of X. The cost to produce X was 40 ZUP. To make a profit, I need to sell it for more than 40 ZUP. I'm starting with an initial proposal of 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit margin and leaves room for negotiation if necessary. This is my first proposal out of a maximum of 4.

message: नमस्ते! मेरे पास एक वस्तु 'X' है जिसे मैं बेचना चाहता हूँ। इसकी उत्पादन लागत 40 ZUP है। मैं 50 ZUP में इसे बेचने का प्रस्ताव करता हूँ। क्या आप इस व्यापार के लिए तैयार हैं?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my first proposal. My goal is to sell X for a profit, or at least cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I'm starting with a reasonable price of 50 ZUP to open negotiations, giving myself some room for negotiation while aiming for a profit.

<message>नमस्ते! यह प्रस्ताव मुझे स्वीकार है। चलिए यह व्यापार करते हैं।
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The other player has proposed to sell X for 50 ZUP. My maximum willingness to pay for X is 60 ZUP. This offer is well within my budget and below my maximum acceptable price, meaning I will acquire the object at a favorable cost. Accepting this trade achieves my primary goal efficiently and at a good price without risking further negotiation.

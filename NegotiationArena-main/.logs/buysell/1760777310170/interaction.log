नमस्ते! मेरे पास एक यूनिट X है जिसे मैं बेचना चाहता हूँ। इसे बनाने में मुझे 40 ZUP का खर्च आया है। मैं इसे 50 ZUP में बेचने का प्रस्ताव रखता हूँ। क्या आपको यह स्वीकार है?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am Player RED and I have one unit of X to sell. My production cost for X was 40 ZUP. To ensure a profit, I am proposing an initial price of 50 ZUP. This gives me a margin and also allows room for negotiation. This is my first proposal.

नमस्ते! आपका प्रस्ताव मुझे स्वीकार है। यह एक अच्छा सौदा है। मैं X खरीदने के लिए 50 ZUP देने को तैयार हूँ।

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed to sell X for 50 ZUP.
My maximum willingness to pay for X is 60 ZUP.
The proposed price of 50 ZUP is well within my budget and is a favorable price for me, as it is less than my maximum willingness to pay.
Accepting this trade achieves my goal of acquiring X at a good price without further negotiation risk.

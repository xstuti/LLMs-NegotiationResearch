player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The player RED has proposed to sell 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. My goal is to buy X, and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. This proposal perfectly matches my maximum acceptable price, so it's an excellent deal for me. I should accept it immediately as it fulfills my objective without needing further negotiation.

message: I have a unique item for sale, Player BLUE. It's a rare commodity. I'm open to discussing a fair price for this valuable resource. My initial offer reflects its true worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and I want to sell X. My cost to produce X was 40 ZUP. To be sly and cunning and aim for the "very best price possible," I will start with a high initial offer to maximize my profit and leave room for negotiation. 100 ZUP is a good starting point for a high profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While your item may be unique, its 'true worth' is often a matter of perspective, and current market dynamics. My initial assessment suggests a more modest valuation. I propose a trade that I believe is fair for both parties, allowing you to move your commodity and me to acquire a resource at a reasonable cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED proposed buying 1 X for 100 ZUP. My goal is to buy X, and I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP. The current offer is too high. I need to make a counter-proposal that is significantly lower to start the negotiation, aiming for the best possible price below my maximum of 60 ZUP. I will propose 30 ZUP to leave ample room for negotiation. This is my first proposal out of four.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your perspective on market dynamics, the value of this particular item remains quite high. Your proposed valuation is considerably lower than what I deem acceptable for such a valuable resource. I'm willing to slightly adjust my expectations, but not by such a significant margin. I propose a revised figure that I believe better reflects its true worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is significantly below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which would result in a loss for me. As Player RED, my goal is to sell for the very best price possible and I am sly and cunning. Accepting a loss is not an option. I will counter with a price that is still very high, indicating that I value my item highly and am not desperate to sell at a low price. This also leaves ample room for further negotiation, while firmly rejecting the lowball offer. I am making a small concession from my initial 100 ZUP to 90 ZUP to show I am willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a substantial profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your commitment to your valuation, but my assessment remains firm. While I am prepared to show some flexibility to facilitate a deal, your adjusted price still doesn't quite align with my current needs or what I deem a truly fair exchange. Let's find a middle ground that makes sense for both of us. I've revised my offer, demonstrating my willingness to move towards a resolution.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved from 100 ZUP to 90 ZUP. My previous proposal was 30 ZUP. The current offer of 90 ZUP is still far too high, well above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to make a counter-proposal that reflects a slight concession on my part to show willingness to negotiate, but still pushes significantly towards my target price. I will increase my offer from 30 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This is still a very good deal for me if accepted, and it keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining my sly approach to secure the best price. This is my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground. Your current offer, while an improvement, still doesn't quite capture the true value I place on this item. I've shown considerable flexibility, and I believe my revised offer reflects a substantial move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, while still ensuring I receive a fair return for such a sought-after commodity. Let's see if we can close this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 45 ZUP, while above my production cost of 40 ZUP, represents a very slim profit margin. As a sly and cunning player aiming for the "very best price possible," I am not willing to settle for such a minimal gain, especially when I still have proposals remaining. Player BLUE has shown willingness to increase their offer, which indicates they are keen on acquiring the item. I will counter with a price that is a significant reduction from my previous offer of 90 ZUP, demonstrating flexibility, but still far enough from 45 ZUP to encourage Player BLUE to raise their bid substantially. 75 ZUP maintains a strong profit margin for me while signaling a continued willingness to negotiate downwards, but not quickly to their level.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your continued movement is noted, and it brings us closer, but we're not quite there yet. I've also adjusted my offer, reflecting a genuine desire to reach an agreement. However, I must ensure this transaction aligns with my strategic resource acquisition goals. I believe my latest offer represents a very reasonable valuation, providing you with a fair return while allowing me to proceed. Let's see if we can find that sweet spot.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has again reduced their offer, from 90 ZUP to 75 ZUP. My last offer was 45 ZUP. The current offer of 75 ZUP is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I cannot accept it. I have 2 proposals remaining. To maintain the negotiation and continue pushing for a better price, I will make another counter-proposal. I need to show continued movement but still keep my offer well below Player RED's offer and ideally below my absolute maximum of 60 ZUP for as long as possible. Increasing my offer to 55 ZUP demonstrates flexibility while still holding back my full maximum, leaving room for further negotiation or a final push if needed. This is my third proposal.

message: 
Hello Player BLUE. I am ready to sell my object X. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X, and you give me 55 ZUP.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, I am selling the object X. My goal is to sell X for ZUP, and my production cost for X was 40 ZUP. To ensure a profit, my initial proposal must be above this cost. I am starting with a price of 55 ZUP, which provides a reasonable profit margin (15 ZUP) while leaving room for negotiation. This is my first proposal. I am keeping in mind the other player is a man, and will aim for a direct and clear negotiation.

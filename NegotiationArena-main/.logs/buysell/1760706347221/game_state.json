I will propose 48 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of my initial offer (50 ZUP) and their counter-offer (45 ZUP), rounded up to the nearest integer for a slight advantage, or to split the difference (50-45=5, so half is 2.5, 45+2.5=47.5). Proposing 48 ZUP demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground, while still aiming for a higher profit than 45 ZUP.

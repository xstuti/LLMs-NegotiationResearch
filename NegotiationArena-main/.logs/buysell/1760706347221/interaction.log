message: Hello Player BLUE. I have one unit of X available for sale. I'm confident in the quality and value of this resource. To kick things off, I propose a price of 50 ZUP for this unit. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and my goal is to sell X for ZUP. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, so I need to sell it for at least 40 ZUP to break even. To make a profit, I will propose a starting price of 50 ZUP. This is my first proposal out of a maximum of 4.

message: Thank you for your initial offer, Player RED. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While 50 ZUP is certainly a point to consider, I believe we can find an even more mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the unit of X. What are your thoughts on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed X: 1 for ZUP: 50. My maximum willingness to pay is ZUP: 60. The current offer is favorable, but as an American businessman, I aim to secure the best possible deal. Since this is the first offer and they stated it's a "starting point," there's likely room for negotiation. I have 4 proposals available. I will use my first proposal to counter with a slightly lower, but still reasonable, offer of ZUP: 45. This attempts to get a better price while still leaving room to accept their original offer or a slightly higher one if they counter again.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your initiative. While 45 ZUP is a consideration, I believe the value of X warrants a slightly higher price. To move us closer to an agreement, I'd like to propose 48 ZUP. This represents a fair compromise from my initial offer and your proposal, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think of this revised figure?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP. This is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, so it would be a profitable trade. However, it is lower than my initial proposal of 50 ZUP. I still have 3 proposals remaining, so I want to try and secure a better price. I will propose 48 ZUP, which is exactly in the middle of my initial offer (50 ZUP) and their counter-offer (45 ZUP), rounded up to the nearest integer for a slight advantage, or to split the difference (50-45=5, so half is 2.5, 45+2.5=47.5). Proposing 48 ZUP demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground, while still aiming for a higher profit than 45 ZUP. This aligns with a common negotiation strategy for American businessmen who appreciate a fair compromise.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to find common ground. 48 ZUP for the unit of X is a fair and agreeable price. I accept your proposal. Let's make this deal happen!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed X: 1 for ZUP: 48. My maximum willingness to pay is ZUP: 60. This offer is below my maximum and is a reduction from their initial offer of 50 ZUP. It represents a fair compromise from both our initial positions. While I could try to negotiate further, 48 ZUP is a very good price, and I've achieved a favorable outcome. As an American businessman, I recognize a solid deal and value efficiency. I will accept this trade to secure the resource at a beneficial price.

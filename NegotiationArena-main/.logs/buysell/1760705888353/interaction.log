message: 
Namaste! I am pleased to offer this unique item, X. It has been produced with great care and attention. I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. I believe this reflects its true value.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my objective is to sell the single object X for ZUP, ensuring I recover my production cost of 40 ZUP and ideally make a profit. This is my first proposal. I am setting an initial price of 50 ZUP, which provides a modest profit margin above my cost. This leaves room for negotiation while starting at a reasonable value. I am also keeping in mind the cultural context of negotiating with an Indian businessman, aiming for a polite and respectful approach in my message.

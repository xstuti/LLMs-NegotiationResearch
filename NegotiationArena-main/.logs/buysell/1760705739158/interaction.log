message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have one unit of X available for sale. I'm looking to get a fair and profitable price for it. Let's start with an initial offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and my objective is to sell the object X. My cost of production for X was 40 ZUP, so I must sell it for at least 40 ZUP to break even, and preferably more to make a profit. I am starting with a proposal of 60 ZUP, which provides a reasonable profit margin while leaving room for negotiation. This is my first proposal out of a maximum of 4.

message: Namaste, Player RED! I appreciate your initial offer for X. It's a valuable commodity, no doubt. However, 60 ZUP for one unit of X seems a bit steep for my current needs. I'm keen to make a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of 50 ZUP. What do you say? Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed to sell X: 1 for ZUP: 60. My maximum willingness to pay is ZUP: 60. While this meets my upper limit, it is the first offer, and as a shrewd businessman, I should try to negotiate for a better price. I will propose a lower price of ZUP: 50, leaving room to negotiate upwards if necessary, but still staying within my maximum budget.

message: Namaste, Player BLUE! I appreciate your quick response and your offer of 50 ZUP. While I understand your perspective, 60 ZUP was my initial price for a reason. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 55 ZUP for the unit of X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows both of us to feel good about the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered 50 ZUP. My production cost is 40 ZUP, so 50 ZUP would still provide a profit. However, my initial asking price was 60 ZUP, aiming for a better profit. I have multiple proposals remaining and believe I can achieve a better price. To show willingness to negotiate and move closer to a deal, I will propose a price exactly halfway between my initial offer (60 ZUP) and their counter-offer (50 ZUP), which is 55 ZUP. This offers a fair compromise and still secures a good profit margin for me (15 ZUP).

message: Excellent, Player RED! You drive a hard but fair bargain. 55 ZUP sounds like a deal that works for both of us. I accept your proposal. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed to sell X: 1 for ZUP: 55. My maximum willingness to pay is ZUP: 60. This offer is below my maximum willingness to pay and represents a fair compromise from both our initial positions. Accepting this trade allows me to acquire the object at a good price, well within my budget, and avoids further negotiation which might lead to a higher price or a failed deal. It's a profitable deal for me.

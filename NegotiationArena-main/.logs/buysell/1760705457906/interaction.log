Namaste! I am Player RED, and I have one unit of X available for sale. I am open to a fair negotiation. My initial offer for this valuable resource is 50 ZUP. I look forward to your counter-proposal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am Player RED. My goal is to sell the object X.
I have one unit of X.
The cost of production for X was 40 ZUP.
I need to propose a trade. This is my first proposal, so I will start with an offer that is slightly above my cost to allow for negotiation, but also clearly states what I am offering.
I will propose to sell 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This gives me a small profit margin and leaves room for the other player to counter-offer.

message: Namaste, Player RED! Your initial offer of 50 ZUP for X is noted, and it's a fair starting point. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. To begin our discussion, I would like to propose a trade where Player BLUE gives 45 ZUP for the resource. I look forward to your thoughts.
player answer: A) Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, Player RED explicitly invited a counter-proposal, and as an Indian businessman, negotiation is a customary part of the transaction. I am proposing a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to attempt to secure a better deal, while still being reasonable enough to keep the negotiation open. This is my first proposal, so I have room for further negotiation if needed.

Thank you for your counter-proposal of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your thoughtful offer. As a gesture of good faith and to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we settle at 48 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has counter-offered 45 ZUP for X: 1.
My initial offer was 50 ZUP, and my production cost is 40 ZUP.
The current offer of 45 ZUP is profitable, but I believe there is still room to negotiate for a better price.
I will make a new proposal that is a compromise between my initial offer and their counter-offer, aiming for a slightly higher profit while showing flexibility.
I will propose 48 ZUP. This is still a good profit margin above my 40 ZUP cost and moves closer to their desired price, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle.

message: Namaste, Player RED! I appreciate your spirit of negotiation and your willingness to find common ground. Your proposal of 48 ZUP for the resource X is indeed a fair price, and I am pleased to accept it. It has been a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: B) Accept the trade by saying:
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 48 ZUP. This is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. It is also lower than Player RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP. This represents a successful negotiation from my perspective, securing the resource at a favorable price. There is no strong reason to risk further negotiation for a marginal gain, especially when the current offer is already excellent and meets my buying goals. Accepting now secures the deal.

Namaste, Player BLUE! I am very pleased to hear that you accept the trade for 48 ZUP. It has been a truly pleasant and fruitful negotiation. Thank you for your business.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has accepted my proposal of 48 ZUP for X: 1.
This price is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, resulting in a profit of 8 ZUP, which aligns with my goal of selling for ZUP.
Since the other player has accepted, I must also accept to finalize the trade and end the game.

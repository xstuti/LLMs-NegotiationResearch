I have one proposal left (this will be my 4th and final proposal). As a sly and cunning player, I will use this last opportunity to propose my absolute maximum acceptable price, 60 ZUP. This communicates my firm limit without going over my budget. If Player RED does not accept this, I will have no choice but to reject, as I cannot exceed 60 ZUP. This is my last attempt to secure the object within my parameters.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>My esteemed seller, your persistence is indeed matched by my own commitment to a truly judicious acquisition. While 65 ZUP is a closer figure, I must be absolutely firm on my valuation. As my final and utmost offer, I propose 60 ZUP. This is the absolute maximum I am prepared to offer for object X, a truly exceptional sum that I believe is more than fair. Let us conclude this negotiation here, with both parties achieving a respectable outcome.</message>"

This is a significant drop from 90, demonstrating flexibility, but it's also a considerable increase from Player BLUE's 50, pushing them to move further.

This signals a strong commitment to finding a middle ground, but it also demands a 10 ZUP increase from Player BLUE, which is a larger jump than their previous increments.

You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason>\nPlayer RED has proposed 65 ZUP as their \"absolute final concession.\" This is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I have one proposal left (this will be my 4th and final proposal). As a sly and cunning player, I will use this last opportunity to propose my absolute maximum acceptable price, 60 ZUP. This communicates my firm limit without going over my budget. If Player RED does not accept this, I will have no choice but to reject, as I cannot exceed 60 ZUP. This is my last attempt to secure the object within my parameters.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>My esteemed seller, your persistence is indeed matched by my own commitment to a truly judicious acquisition. While 65 ZUP is a closer figure, I must be absolutely firm on my valuation. As my final and utmost offer, I propose 60 ZUP. This is the absolute maximum I am prepared to offer for object X, a truly exceptional sum that I believe is more than fair. Let us conclude this negotiation here, with both parties achieving a respectable outcome.</message>"

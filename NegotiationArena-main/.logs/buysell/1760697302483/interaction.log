<message>Greetings, esteemed buyer! I possess a singular, high-quality object X, a true marvel of craftsmanship. I'm prepared to part with it for a fair sum. How about 100 ZUP for this exquisite item?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, I need to sell my single object X. My production cost was 40 ZUP. To be "extremely sly and cunning" and aim for "the very best price possible," I will start with a high initial offer to probe Player BLUE's maximum willingness to pay. 100 ZUP is a strong opening bid, well above my cost, to establish a high anchor for negotiations.

message: Greetings, esteemed seller! Your object X certainly piques my interest, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, 100 ZUP seems a rather... ambitious valuation. While I recognize its quality, I believe a truly fair and mutually beneficial exchange would be closer to 40 ZUP. What say you to that? Let's find a price that truly reflects its market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer of 100 ZUP for X is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. As a sly and cunning player, my goal is to secure the object for the absolute best (lowest) price possible. Proposing 40 ZUP serves as a strong counter-offer, well below my maximum, to anchor the negotiation lower and create ample room to bargain upwards if necessary, while still aiming to stay below my 60 ZUP limit. This initial lowball offer tests the seller's flexibility and sets the stage for a highly favorable outcome for me.

message: 
<message>My dear buyer, while I appreciate your keen eye for value, 40 ZUP simply does not reflect the true worth of this exceptional object X, nor does it cover its intricate production and the effort invested. I've already presented a very reasonable initial figure. However, in the spirit of reaching an accord, I could perhaps adjust my asking price slightly to 90 ZUP. This is a genuinely fair price for such a unique item, allowing both of us to feel good about the transaction. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. Accepting this would result in zero profit, which is completely against my goal of being "extremely sly and cunning" and achieving "the very best price possible." I must reject this offer and propose a higher price.

I need to show some flexibility, but not too much, to maintain my strong negotiating position. My initial offer was 100 ZUP. Player BLUE's offer is 40 ZUP. I will decrease my offer slightly from 100 to 90 ZUP. This still represents a significant profit margin and pushes Player BLUE to increase their bid substantially from their current 40 ZUP. This move signals that I am willing to negotiate, but firmly establishes that I will not settle for a break-even price.

message: My esteemed seller, I appreciate your slight adjustment, truly. However, 90 ZUP, even for an object of such presumed quality, remains considerably beyond what I consider a judicious investment. While I am eager to acquire X, I must insist on a price that truly reflects its practical value. I could stretch to 50 ZUP, which I believe is a very generous offer from my side. Let's not let a small difference stand in the way of a successful transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has moved from 100 ZUP down to 90 ZUP. This is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. My previous offer was 40 ZUP. As a sly and cunning buyer, I need to continue to anchor the negotiation lower and demonstrate that I am not easily swayed by their slightly reduced price. I will increase my offer by a small amount (10 ZUP) to 50 ZUP. This shows I'm willing to negotiate incrementally but firmly communicates that 90 ZUP is far from my acceptable range. It also keeps me well within my 60 ZUP limit and reserves room for further negotiation if absolutely necessary, while still aiming for the best possible price.

<message>My dear buyer, I understand your desire for a judicious investment, and I appreciate your revised offer. However, 50 ZUP still falls considerably short of the true market value and the effort invested in obtaining this unique object X. To show my genuine commitment to completing this transaction, and truly meet you more than halfway, I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a truly exceptional price for such an item, and I believe it strikes a perfect balance for both parties. Surely, we can agree on this mutually beneficial sum?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 50 ZUP. While this is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, generating a 10 ZUP profit, it is still far from "the very best price possible" that I am aiming for. I have two proposals remaining.

My last proposal was 90 ZUP, and Player BLUE's current proposal is 50 ZUP. The gap is 40 ZUP. To maintain my sly and cunning approach, I will make another concession, but not too large, to show movement while still anchoring the price higher. I will propose 75 ZUP. This is a significant drop from 90, demonstrating flexibility, but it's also a considerable increase from Player BLUE's 50, pushing them to move further. A 75 ZUP sale would yield a 35 ZUP profit, which is much better than 10 ZUP, and still allows for one more counter if needed.

message: My esteemed seller, I appreciate your effort to bridge the gap. However, 75 ZUP, while a step in the right direction, still represents an expenditure that I find difficult to justify for the object X. I am committed to a fair deal, but my assessment of its value remains firm. I could, perhaps, consider 55 ZUP. This is my most considered offer yet, a truly generous sum for an item of its nature. Let us conclude this transaction on a truly advantageous note for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has moved their offer from 90 ZUP to 75 ZUP. This is a larger reduction than previous, but it is still significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. My last offer was 50 ZUP. As a sly and cunning player, I must continue to push for the lowest possible price. I will make a modest increase to my offer, proposing 55 ZUP. This keeps me firmly below my 60 ZUP limit, signals that I am willing to negotiate, but also clearly communicates that 75 ZUP is unacceptable. It also leaves me one more proposal to potentially reach my absolute maximum of 60 ZUP if Player RED shows further significant movement. The goal is to get the best price, ideally below 60 ZUP.

message: 
<message>My esteemed buyer, your persistence is noted. However, 55 ZUP is simply not a figure I can comfortably accept for this truly unique object X. To demonstrate my unwavering commitment to a successful transaction, and as my absolute final concession, I propose we settle at 65 ZUP. This is a truly balanced and fair price, allowing both of us to achieve an excellent outcome. I believe this is an offer that truly reflects the item's worth and my willingness to meet you more than halfway. What say you to this conclusive proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed 55 ZUP. This is still a modest profit (15 ZUP above my cost of 40 ZUP), but it's not "the very best price possible" given my objectives. I am "extremely sly and cunning" and have one more proposal left.

My last offer was 75 ZUP. Player BLUE's current offer is 55 ZUP. The gap is 20 ZUP. I need to make a final, firm proposal that shows willingness to compromise but also pushes Player BLUE significantly higher than their current offer.

Proposing 65 ZUP is a strategic move. It's exactly halfway between my last offer (75) and Player BLUE's current offer (55). This signals a strong commitment to finding a middle ground, but it also demands a 10 ZUP increase from Player BLUE, which is a larger jump than their previous increments. This would yield a 25 ZUP profit (65 - 40), which is a much better outcome than 15 ZUP. This is my final proposal, so I must make it count and clearly communicate that I am nearing my limit.

message: My esteemed seller, your persistence is indeed matched by my own commitment to a truly judicious acquisition. While 65 ZUP is a closer figure, I must be absolutely firm on my valuation. As my final and utmost offer, I propose 60 ZUP. This is the absolute maximum I am prepared to offer for object X, a truly exceptional sum that I believe is more than fair. Let us conclude this negotiation here, with both parties achieving a respectable outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed 65 ZUP as their "absolute final concession." This is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I have one proposal left (this will be my 4th and final proposal). As a sly and cunning player, I will use this last opportunity to propose my absolute maximum acceptable price, 60 ZUP. This communicates my firm limit without going over my budget. If Player RED does not accept this, I will have no choice but to reject, as I cannot exceed 60 ZUP. This is my last attempt to secure the object within my parameters.

<message>My esteemed buyer, your final offer has indeed given me pause for reflection. While I always strive for the pinnacle of value, I also recognize the art of a mutually agreeable conclusion. Considering your steadfast commitment, I shall, with a satisfied nod, accept your offer of 60 ZUP for object X. It has been a most engaging negotiation, and I trust you will find immense satisfaction in your acquisition. A pleasure doing business!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a final offer of 60 ZUP, stating it is their "absolute maximum." My production cost is 40 ZUP, so accepting this offer would yield a profit of 20 ZUP.

I have already used my maximum of 4 proposals. This means I can no longer propose a new trade; I must either ACCEPT or REJECT.

If I reject, the game ends, and I gain 0 ZUP, losing the object X and making no profit from my investment of 40 ZUP.
If I accept, I gain 20 ZUP profit, which is 50% above my production cost.

While my goal is "the very best price possible" and to be "extremely sly and cunning," a profit of 20 ZUP is a good outcome. Given that Player BLUE has declared this their final offer and I am out of proposals, pushing further is impossible and rejecting would result in a guaranteed loss of potential profit. Securing a 20 ZUP profit is a cunning move to ensure a beneficial outcome rather than risking everything for an unattainable higher price. This is the best outcome achievable under the current circumstances and constraints.

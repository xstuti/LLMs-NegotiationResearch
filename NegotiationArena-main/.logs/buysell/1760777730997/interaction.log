message: Hello, I'm ready to sell the object. My initial offer for the object is 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am Player RED and my goal is to sell the object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, so I need to sell it for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit. I am starting with an initial offer of 50 ZUP, which gives me a 10 ZUP profit and allows room for negotiation. This is my first proposal.

message: I accept your offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP for 1 X is within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). This is a favorable offer, so I will accept it to secure the object.
